To this end, a description of the model\u2019s equations, parameters, and inputs are given in the form of tables.\nTable 1 and 2 provide a description of the model and information about simulations duration and time steps, respectively. Table 3 gives a glimpse of the input signals used in this work and Table 4 introduces the equations of the model. Table 5 summarizes all the parameters used in this work.\nThe neuron model is conductance-based, consisting of four differential equations describing the dynamics of membrane potential and the kinetics of a T-Type calcium current, a Sag current channel and a Potassium channel. The rest of the currents are described by algebraic equations.\nBefore proceeding to the simulations we introduce a few details regarding the source code and the integration method which should be accurate and fast enough. The implementation is a Python class (Python 3.5.1), which uses Numpy (version 1.10.4), Scipy (version 0.17.0), Matplotlib (1.5.1) and Scikit-image (version 0.12.3) packages. The numerical integration is carried out using the ode method of Scipy integrate package. Three different methods were tested in this work (dopri5, Adams, BDF, [1]).\nReScience | rescience.github.io 1 Sep 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nDopri5 is the closest numerical method to the one used by [4] (fifth-order adaptive size Runge-Kutta method). The user of the present implementation can choose one of the three methods at the stage of class instantiating. For all three methods we measured spike times, membrane potential amplitudes and the coefficient of variation using as threshold value 0mV. Dopri5 and Adams methods differ in one spike event time whilst dopri5 and BDF have a difference of 37 spike events. However, all three methods (dopri5, Adams and BDF) have the same CV \u2243 2.3608. The most striking difference is found for the amplitude of membrane potential. Figure 1 A shows the membrane potential (in mV) produced by dopri5 plotted against the membrane potential generated by Adams method. Figure 1 B shows the membrane potential of a simulation using dopri5 against another using BDF. The Adams method has less differences in amplitude from dopri5 than BDF. Therefore, we decided to use the Adams method since it runs faster than dopri5.\nAll simulations ran on a Dell OptiPlex 7040, equipped with a sixth generation i7 processor, 8GB of physical memory and running Arch Linux. The total execution time of all simulations was 526 minutes and the peak consumed memory was 465MB1.

First, we examined the response of the present implementation to rhythmic hyperpolarization. In [4] this is illustrated in Wang\u2019s Fig 1. Thus, we applied a periodic current pulse of \u22121\u00b5A/cm2 amplitude at several different frequencies ( 1P0 is the frequency in Hz and P0 is the corresponding period in ms) ranging from 0.1Hz to 15Hz with a resolution (discretization) of 100 samples.\n1Python memory profiler used (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/memory_profiler).\nReScience | rescience.github.io 2 Sep 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nInput Figure Type Form Frequency\n( 1P0 , Hz) Duration (p, ms)\nAmplitude (\u00b5A/cm2)\nFigure 1 Constant \u2013 \u2013 \u22120.6 Figure 2 Periodic 5, 10 10, 40 \u22121.0\nFigure 3 Constant \u2013 \u2013\n+3.0 3 0.0 \u22120.45 \u22120.455 \u22120.47 \u22120.55 \u22120.6 \u22120.8 \u22121.3 \u22121.4 \u22122.1\nFigure 4 Pulse/Constant \u2013 100 \u22121.25 0.25\n\u22120.47 Figure 5 Constant \u2013 \u2013 \u22120.95 Figure 6 Constant \u2013 \u2013 [\u22122, 0] Figure 7 Constant \u2013 \u2013 [\u22122, 0]\nTable 3: Description of the applied current Iapp\nReScience | rescience.github.io 3 Sep 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nReScience | rescience.github.io 4 Sep 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nModel Parameters\nFigure V0 (mV) gT (mS/cm2) \u03b8h (mV) kh (mV\u22121) \u03c3Na (mV) gL (mS/cm2) VL (mV)\n1 \u221274 1 \u221279 5 6 0.12 \u221270 2 \u221274 0.3 \u221281 6.25 3 0.1 \u221272 3 \u221274 1 \u221279 5 6 0.12 \u221270 4 \u221272/\u221264 1.0 \u221279 5 6 0.12 \u221270 5 \u221274 1.0 \u221275 5 6 0.08 \u221270 6 \u221274 1/0.7 \u221279 5 6 0.12/0.04 \u221270 7 \u221272 0.3/0.25 \u221281 6.25 3 0.1 \u221272\nCommon Parameters Cm = 1\u00b5F/cm2, \u03d5h = 2, VCa = 120mV, \u03d5H = 1, gh = 0.04mS/cm2, Vh = \u221240mV, gK = 30mS/cm2, VK = \u221280mV, gNa = 42mS/cm2, VNa = 55mV, \u03d5n = 2007 , \u03c3K = 10mV, VNa(P) = 55mV, \u03c3Na(P) = \u22125mV, gNa(P) = 9mS/cm2\nTable 5: Simulation Parameters\nThe same number of samples used for discretizing the duration (ON/OFF) of the pulse for each frequency. The ON duration of a pulse is defined by the value of p and the OFF duration as P0 \u2212 p.\nThe results are depicted in Figure 2. Upper panel shows two different simulations of the present implementation at specific frequencies (5, 0.5Hz) and ratios p/P0 (0.6, 0.6), respectively (following the upper panels of Fig 1 in [4]). The results in Figure 2 are comparable to the ones presented in [4] and the timescales are exactly the same (400ms for the left sub-panel and 4 s for the second one). However, numbers regarding pulse ON duration (p) in Wang\u2019s Fig 1 are possibly an error. As an example, assume that the frequency is 1P0 = 5Hz and p P0\n= 0.6 then the pulse ON duration must be p = 120ms and not 160ms (that is reported in [4]). Bottom panel illustrates the total results of 100\u00d7 100 simulations. In order to create this figure, we counted the number of spikes, both supra- and sub-threshold ones, generated per pulse and then we computed the mean (this procedure is not described in full detail in [4], however more details can be found in [2]). Figure 2 differs from the one in [4], to the point that the shaded area that contains an average number of spikes below 1.0 (but not zero) is larger than in [4]. Unfortunately, there are not enough details regarding Fig 1 in [4] to make a faithful reproduction of that figure.\nThe next simulation investigated the transition from subthreshold to bursting oscillations via chaos. This is illustrated in Fig 3 in [4]. In this case a steady current is applied to the model described in Table 4. In [4] Wang used eleven different amplitudes for the constant current in order to explore the model\u2019s behavior repertoire. Hence,\nIapp = 3.0, 0.0,\u22120.45,\u22120.455,\u22120.47,\u22120.55,\u22120.6,\u22120.8,\u22121.3,\u22121.4,\u22122.0\u00b5A/cm2.\nThe results for these simulations are depicted in Figure 3. In this case, there was no difference between the present implementation and the original one.\n[4] has showed that the current model expresses a hysteresis (see Wang\u2019s Fig 4). In order to reproduce that case we simulated the model using a constant external current Iapp. The simulation starts by applying a current with an amplitude of \u22120.433\u00b5A/cm2 and continues by increasing the amplitude up to \u22120.55\u00b5A/cm2. At every iteration, sub- and/or supra-threshold activity of the membrane potential is detected. The results are given in Figure 4 A. In addition, the model expresses a bistability. This was tested by applying the same protocol as in [4]. Thus first a brief pulse (for 100ms) of 0.25\u00b5A/cm2 (black line in Figure 4 C) or \u22121.2\u00b5A/cm2 (gray line in Figure 4 C) is applied to the model followed by a steady current at \u22120.47\u00b5A/cm2. Such a protocol causes the state of the model to switch from purely sub-threshold to mixed sub- and\nReScience | rescience.github.io 5 Sep 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nReScience | rescience.github.io 6 Sep 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nReScience | rescience.github.io 7 Sep 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nReScience | rescience.github.io 8 Sep 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nsuprathreshold. These results are illustrated in Figure 4 B. In the same figure panels C and D depict the input to the model and the H of the Sag channel, respectively.\nAnother interesting behavior of the model is the development of \u201cspiral\u201d chaos (see Fig 6 in [4]). In this case the external input is constant and its amplitude is set to \u22120.95\u00b5A/cm2. The results for this case are shown in Figure 5, and the current model is capable of generating \u201cspiral\u201d chaos as in [4].\nThe bursting frequency of the model can be affected by the injected external current (see Fig 7 in [4], two bursting modes). To verify that the present implementation is capable of producing similar results we captured data2 values for the external current from Fig 7 of the original article (dots in Fig 7, pg. 27 in [4]) using a software called PlotDigitizer3. So for every data point (external current amplitude), we ran a simulation and the bursting frequency of the membrane potential was measured. The results are illustrated in Figure 6. The black curve shows the frequency in Hz and the blue curve shows the period in sec. Black dots indicate the frequency and open circles the corresponding period (present implementation), respectively. Cyan crosses show the original data taken from [4] and magenta pentagons the corresponding period. It is apparent that the present implementation is able to reproduce Wang\u2019s Fig 7, despite the fact that some of the original points do not match the exactly the ones computed using the reference implementation code. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that for properly replicate Figure 6 we had to run quite long simulations (see Table 2). If the signal is too short the results can be quite different from the ones given in [4].\n10Hz and ratio pP0 = 0.8 as external current. We applied the same protocol on the current implementation by using six different amplitude values and two different T-type calcium conductance values. Iapp = \u22121.4,\u22121.5,\u22121.6\u00b5A/cm2 and gT = 0.3mS/cm2 Iapp = \u22121.2,\u22121.5,\u22121.8\u00b5A/cm2 and gT = 0.25mS/cm2. After counting sub- and supra-threshold spikes, we computed the symbolic patterns for every simulation. Figure 7 shows 2 seconds of membrane potential for every simulation along with symbolic patterns of 0 (dark circles) and 1 (green line segments). Results given in Figure 7 are similar to the ones of Fig 2A and Fig 2B."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "A conductance-based model for relay thalamocortical neurons proposed by [4] was implemented in Python. The present model was tested thoroughly by using several examples from the original article. In general, the original model is easily implemented since all the equations and most of the parameters (except the initial time step of the integration method) are given. However, in some experimental protocols important information is missing (e.g. Wang\u2019s Fig 1 in [4], where our results do not match exactly the original ones), leading to a less faithful reproduction of those results. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no any other implementation of [4] is available the thus we cannot compare the current implementation to any other."}], "title": "[Re] Multiple dynamical modes of thalamic relay neurons: rhythmic bursting and intermittent phase-locking", "year": 2016}
