[1]). The Excel file contains several datasheets. Two were particularly important, as they were the source of the raw data (one contains original species\nReScience | rescience.github.io 1 Apr 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nabundances, the other the nutrient concentrations). We saved these two datasheets, without any alteration, as comma separated value (csv) text files. In the code associated with this reproduction, these data files are read from the associated github repository. Another datasheet contained transformed data (we also saved this as csv file, in order to use it in this reproduction). We also received a dataset direct from Steve Ellner, see below for details.\nThe original abundance dataset contains a duplicated date: 28/10/1996 (row 709 and 710 in excel sheet). We changed this (in R) to 26/10/1996, making the observation occur half way between the two surrounding dates. The Protozoa variable in the original dataset contains some numbers with a comma (instead of period) as the decimal separator; these were changed to periods."}, {"heading": "Reproduction environment", "text": "The R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics (R Core Team [5]) was used to make the reproduction.

We removed zeros by matching the removals to those in the transformed version of the data in the published Excel file mentioned above. Subsequent transformation steps were:\n1. Interpolation to create equally spaced observations in time series. 2. Fourth root transformation. 3. Detrending of five of the time series. 4. Rescaling to zero mean and unit standard deviation.\nThe reproduced transformed data closely matched the published transformed data (figure 2).\nCorrelations among species abundances Correlations among species abundances presented in Table 1 of the original article closely matched our reproduced correlations, calculated from the transformed data with zeros removed (figure 3). Deviations between the original and reproduced correlations are relatively small and infrequent.\nHighlighted in the text of the original paper were: negative correlations of picophytoplankton with protozoa, and of nanophytoplankton both with rotifers and calanoid copepods, positive correlation of picophytoplankton with calanoid copepods, negative correlation between bacteria and ostracods, and positive correlation between bacteria and phosphorus. All of these correlations were at least qualitatively reproduced."}, {"heading": "Spectral analyses", "text": "Spectral analyses in the original paper were presented graphically in figures S3 (raw spectrograms) and S4 (Welch periodograms).

The reproduced results (figure 4) are consistent with this statement. The original article also stated that the analyses \u201cyielded significantly positive Lyapunov exponents of strikingly similar value for all species (Fig. 3; mean exponent = 0.057 per day, s.d. = 0.005 per day, n = 9)\u201d. Reproduced exponents had very similar mean value, but had larger standard deviation (mean = 0.060 and s.d. = 0.014), resulting from quantitative differences in reproduced divergence rates (figure 4) and therefore Lyapunov exponents (figure 5).\nLyapunov exponents by indirect method The data received directly from Stephen Ellner (file \u2018interp_short_allsystem_newnames.csv\u2019 in the reproduction repository) was interpolated, but without zeros removed. The reproduced interpolated data, without zeros removed, matched closely this data (figure 6).\nThe original paper reported a global Lyapunov exponent calculated via two modelling approaches (neural network and generalised additive models [GAMs]). Only the GAM approach was reproduced, with the assistance of code donated by Stephen Ellner. The original article obtained a global Lyapunov exponent of 0.08 per day. The reproduced value was 0.04. We did not reproduce the bootstrapping used to give confidence intervals around this estimate.\nReScience | rescience.github.io 5 Apr 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nReScience | rescience.github.io 6 Apr 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1"}, {"heading": "Predictability decay", "text": "The article stated: \u201cFor short-term forecasts of only a few days, most species had a high predictability of R2 = 0.70 \u2013 0.90 (Fig. 2). However, the predictability of the species was much reduced when prediction times were extended to 15\u201330 days.\u201d The reproduced predictabilities, which were calculated from the GAMs, were consistent with these qualitative statements, and were most often quantitatively similar (7).

For example, all Lyapunov exponents estimated by direct method were positive, as in the original article. Quantitative differences may have resulted from difference in algorithms used. For example, the original used the Tisean software to calculate Lyapunov exponents. As this was available from CRAN until mid 2014 and since it is a bit less well integrated with R, we instead used the tseriesChaos package (Fabio Di Narzo [2]), which in any case was largely inspired by the TISEAN project. In addition, there may have been some difference in algorithm parameters, as not all parameters required by the function we used were reported in the original ms.\nQuantitative differences in predictability decay (figure 7) remain unexplained, though could result from original analyses using neural networks, and the reproduction using GAMs. The difference in estimate of the global Lyapunov exponent (0.08 in the\nReScience | rescience.github.io 7 Apr 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\noriginal article and 0.04 here) appears to be due to difference in data used (illustrated in figure 6).\nIn conclusion, this reproduction supports the general scientific conclusions of the original article, but also shows how difficult can be an accurate quantitative reproduction, even in the presence of the extensive methodological details provided alongside the original article."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This reproduction was made as part of the Reproducible Research in Ecology, Evolution, Behaviour, and Environmental Studies (RREEBES) Course, lead by Owen Petchey at the University of Zurich.
