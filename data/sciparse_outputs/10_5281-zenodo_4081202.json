Fortunately, this URL still resolves (my colleague is still at the same institution), and does indeed contain a downloadable zip file with a copy of the code. In 2012, I had uploaded a copy of this code as a supplement to Dryad, but both on my CV at the time and on my colleague\u2019s website we had recorded only the Dryad handle URL, http://da tadryad.org/handle/10255/dryad.37625, which no longer resolves. That handle can be resolved by the WayBackMachine, which doesn\u2019t contain the code archive but does reveal the DOI, http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.j8n0p7vc, which successfully resolves to the Dryad copy. The code can also be found by searching the Dryad web interface for my surname (though it is listed as \u201cdata\u201d and not \u201csoftware.\u201d In 2017, I had also imported the GitHub copy into the Zenodo data repository where it was again assigned a DOI and is identified as software in the metadata. I note that the package was never submitted to the Central R Archive Network, CRAN.\nNotably, these versions are not entirely the same. The GitHub/Zenodo/Dryad version has the addition of a configure.ac script for autoconf, intended to make the package more portable in assisting with the linkage to the GSL library, which is missing from the original deposit (on the GeorgiaTech website and Dryad). The GitHub version also lacked a copy of the inst/ sub\u2010directory, which contained a copy of the manuscript .tex file, original manuscript .pdf figures, and the R scripts that were supposed to generate these figures. (Though both versions include a demo directory that included similar code required to generate the figures, as discussed in the next section.)"}, {"heading": "Execution", "text": "I had taken what I thought at the time would be appropriate steps to facilitate repro\u2010 ducibility, stating at the end of the manuscript:\nIn the spirit of scientifically reproducible research(Gentleman and Lang, 2007; Schwabet al., 2000; Stodden, 2009), we freely provide all the source code required to replicate the simulations and figures shown in the text. Though the numerical simulations are written in C for computational efficiency, we provide a user interface and documentation by releasing all the code, figures, text, and examples as a software package for the widely used and freely available R statistical computing language. This package can be downloaded from http://ecotheory.biology.gatech.edu/downloads/.\nUnfortunately, in attempting execution I ran into two significant obstacles that would have likely stopped a typical researcher unfamiliar with the details of the project.\nFirst, the formally archived copy (GitHub/Dryad/Zenodo version) could not be installed directly due in fact to the autoconf configure script, which incorrectly states that it cannot find a version of the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) >=1.8 (the version against which the package was originally built \u2013 the current stable version is 2.6, see http://gi t.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gsl.git/tree/NEWS for the changelog). Ironically, the original GeorgiaTech archive version installed directly for me on both Mac and Linux platforms without any additional work (the default library linking flags in the provided Makevars file of the original source were sufficient.) For instance, on a standard Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic) instance with r-base, and libgsl-dev installed from the apt repos, it was sufficient for me to run:\n> wget http://ecotheory.biology.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/adpaper_0.2\u20108.tar.gz > R CMD INSTALL adpaper_0.2-8.tar.gz The same strategy worked on MacOSX (Catalina) with gsl installed via Homebrew. I was able to update the original autoconf script by recalling that it had been adapted from another package, the gsl R package https://cran.r\u2010project.org/web/packages/gsl/,\nReScience C 6.1 (#15) \u2013 Boettiger 2020 2\nwhich also binds against the GSL library. Working from the autoconf files provided there, I could successfully get the package to configure and compile. This highlights a potential risk in changes that are intended to make the package more portable but also add complexity. More generally, while the package has no dependency on external R packages (beyond those default packages provided as part of base R: stats, utils, graphics, and grDevices, this issue illustrates the familiar reproducibility challenge that is created by changing versions of dependencies and system libraries (GSL in this case). System libraries against which a package is compiled are particularly pernicious, because versioning of these components is both platform dependent and separate from the R packagemanager process, and thus cannot be addressedmerely with package ver\u2010 sion tracking in tools such as packrat (Ushey et al. 2018) or renv (Ushey 2019). Today, containerized approaches such as Docker (see Boettiger 2015; Boettiger and Eddelbuet\u2010 tel 2017) provide a solution to this system\u2010dependency issue that was not available a decade ago.\nThe second challengewas in figuring out just what commands had to be run to duplicate the figures. Asmentioned above, the GitHub version of the source\u2010code did not have the manuscript source, and even the version that did have the manuscript source did not write the manuscript itself as a dynamic document (e.g. in Sweave (Xie 2015)). In that version, files fig1.R and fig2.R are were included in the same sub\u2010directory as the pdf figures referenced by the tex version of the manuscript, but these files contained only the code required to actually generate the figures themselves once the result data had been pre\u2010computed and saved as .txt files. The result data files had also not been archived separately. Fortunately, re\u2010reading my own documentation, I was able to de\u2010 duce that these text files were generated by running the function logistic()with the parameter settings given in the caption of Fig 2 in the manuscript.\nReproducibility \u2014 Running the logistic() function provided in the code, I was able to replicate the key results of the paper. A few qualifications here are necessary. The pa\u2010 per consists of two core results \u2013 a theoretical (i.e. derived analytically without compu\u2010 tational component) which predicts the existence of \u2018fluctuation enhancement regimes\u2019 which can create substantial deviations from the dynamics predicted by the accepted theory at the time (that is, from the so\u2010called canonical equation of adaptive dynamics), and a second result which relies on a computationally intensive stochastic ensemble simulation to illustrate these deviations arising for dynamics that begin in the \u201cfluctu\u2010 ation enhancement\u201d regime. These results are summarized by figures 1 and 2 of the original paper, which I reproduce here.\nReproducing figure 1 worked directly from the provided code, which merely plots equa\u2010 tions derived from a little stochastic calculus as presented in the paper and appendix: library(fluctuationDomains) ## Figure 1 function definitions: logistic_curve = function(x){-x*exp(-x*x/2)} chemostat_curve <- function(x, d = 0.1, q = 0.1){\n(q*x-d/(1-x*d))* (d/x-2*d**2) } branching_curve <- function(x, SIGMA2_K = 2, SIGMA2_C = 1){\n-exp( (x^2/2)*(4/SIGMA2_C -1/SIGMA2_K) ) * (SIGMA2_C+exp(2*x^2/SIGMA2_C)*SIGMA2_C-2*SIGMA2_K)*x / ( (1+exp(2*x^2/SIGMA2_C)^2)*SIGMA2_C*SIGMA2_K)\n}\nlandscape(logistic_curve, -3, 3) landscape(chemostat_curve, 1, 9) landscape(branching_curve, -.8, .8)\nReScience C 6.1 (#15) \u2013 Boettiger 2020 3\nFigure 2 of the original paper has the core computational results demonstrating the con\u2010 sequences of these fluctuation regimes. The code for this analysis was implemented as pure C code, which can be run in stand\u2010alonemode and generates three output text files. The R package uses the .C interface to pass parameters to the C function (Rlogistic) which runs the ensemble and writes its output as text. The C function does not expose a random seed, so re\u2010running the analysis creates results which are not bit\u2010wise identical each time. Of course the scientific results are expected to be independent of the seed anyway, so it is perhaps reassuring that as long as the ensemble of replicates is large enough, the same pattern can be reproduced quite closely. The original manuscript uses ensembles of 100,000 replicates, which I have reproduced here. A possible source of confusion is that the code defaults to only 100 replicates if the ensemble size is not explicitly verified \u2013 which is an ensemble small enough to still see random deviations from the predicted results. I probably set that lower default to facilitate faster testing. Likewise, the MAXTIME parameter has to be extended from the default setting to allow the third initial condition set to run sufficiently long.\nThe code was never parallelized, but runs with a small memory footprint by streaming simulation data out (e.g. to disk) over fprint. Replicating all results takes about an hour of computational time on a Intel\u2010i7 processor. out = logistic(Xo = 1, ENSEMBLES = 10^5, MAX_TIME = 3000)\nout = logistic(Xo = 2, ENSEMBLES = 10^5, MAX_TIME = 5000)\nout = logistic(Xo = 3, ENSEMBLES = 10^5, MAX_TIME = 10000)\nOn the R package compendium \u2014My original paper acknowledges the use of the R package compendium approach (Gentleman and Temple Lang 2007) for reproducible research, and idea later developed in Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen (2018). While a decade ago the package as created would pass R\u2019s built\u2010in R CMD check routine, standards have since evolved and the current implementation would not do so:\n\u2022 The C methods are expected to bind R\u2019s random number generator engines, and not use their ownmethods, which allows them to coordinatewith standardRmeth\u2010 ods for setting seed and so forth. \u2022 Data should be passed by reference back to R and not serialized to disk (though this can introduce memory constraints). \u2022 It is now also standard practice to register the C routines explicitly. \u2022 SystemRequirements field was not provided in the package DESCRIPTION. By adding this to list libgsl, it is possible to have the package successfully install on the rhub (Cs\u00e1rdi and Salmon 2019) testing platforms.\nNote that these tighter integration would also prevent the C libraries from running as purely stand\u2010alone implementation. In any event, meeting all the automated checks of a formal package is not an expectation of the compendium approach, which merely borrows some of the package tooling.\nA dynamic document using RMarkdown (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018) for repro\u2010 ducing the present manuscript can be found in the rescience sub\u2010directory which I have now added to the GitHub repository housing the original R package, https://gith ub.com/cboettig/fluctuationDomains, git tag rescience-submission, now archived with DOI https://doi.org/xxxx.\nReScience C 6.1 (#15) \u2013 Boettiger 2020 4\nx2\n\u2320 \u2321 0\nx a 1(y\n)d y\n\u22123 \u22122 \u22121 0 1 2 3\nTrait, x\na 1(x\n)\nx2\n\u2320 \u2321 0\nx a 1(y\n)d y\n2 4 6 8\nTrait, x\na 1(x\n)\nx2\n\u2320 \u2321 0\nx a 1(y\n)d y\n\u22120.5 0.0 0.5\nTrait, x\na 1(x\n)\nFigure 1.

As the original results were not performed with a fixed random seed, replicated results are sta\u2010 tistically comparable but not bit\u2010wise identical. In a scientific sense this is perhapsmore useful than replication with a fixed seed. My compendium approach did not install en\u2010 tirely out of the box, as an autoconf configure script first required updating. Ironically, the original version of the code published on a co\u2010author\u2019s personal website and linked from the manuscript both still existed and did install out\u2010of\u2010the\u2010box.

I think this experience underscored the critical role dependency management has in frustrating reproducibility: this replication was relatively simple in part due to the low number of dependencies and the technical simplicity of the code. The other take\u2010away for me is how easy it is to leave out small but important steps needed to reproduce a figure when not using the dynamic document approach.
