[Biophys J 69, 840-848 (1995)]\n2 Targets\nThe targets for reproduction were the following.\n\u2022 Calculations on reference assemblies. The original article figure 2 showed a test of the method presented in the article for predicting translational friction coef\u2010 ficients of a series of reference assemblies, whose exact properties had been re\u2010 ported earlier. These assemblies had two shapes (lollipop and dumbbell), and their dimensions were chosen to approximate the dimensions of a nucleosome along with free \u201clinker\u201d DNA.\n\u2022 Hydrodynamic force analysis. Article figure 3 compared the translational force calculated using the Kirkwood\u2010Bloomfield bead approximation coupled with the new method, versus the exact force calculated by the Zimm approach4, as a func\u2010 tion of bead separation depending on the free DNA length in basepairs (bp).\n\u2022 Dinucleosome wrapping calculations. The original article\u2019s figure 4 showed the translational diffusion coefficient for a system consisting of two nucleosomes po\u2010 sitioned on a 354 bpDNA template, calculatedusing thenewmethod andplotted as a function of the number of superhelical turns. The calculations were compared to experimental results from light\u2010scattering experiments on a similar system ob\u2010 tained at two different salt concentrations.\n\u2022 Analyzing a three\u2010nucleosomecompactionprocess. Theoriginalwork also demon\u2010 strated, in figure 5 and a table of values, the potential of the new calculation method for comparing different models for DNA compaction. Sedimentation coef\u2010 ficients were calculated for all possible intermediates in a hypothetical saturation of a 624 bp DNA template with up to three positioned nucleosomes, and the dis\u2010 tributions obtained for histone binding in a cooperative versus a non\u2010cooperative (random assembly) process.\n3 Methods\nThe calculations reported in the 1995 article were all performed with Mathematica ver\u2010 sion 2.2 on a 1992 Macintosh IIci (Motorola 68030 clocked at 25 MHz) running macOS 7.1. All Mathematica notebooks for the article remained accessible throughout the in\u2010 tervening years in my project file directories. The reproducibility tests were performed using two different versions of Mathematica (running on three different platforms):\n\u2022 Mathematica version 5.2, released in 2005, was first used, running on a late\u20102018 13\u2010inch Macbook (Intel core i7, 2.7 GHz) running macOS 10.14 (Mojave). Note that Mathematica 5.2 will no longer run on macOS \u2265 10.15 (Catalina) because it con\u2010 tains 32\u2010bit code.\n\u2022 All code was also run using Mathematica version 12.0, released in 2019, running under Raspbian linux on a Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ and 4 model B.\nThe numerical results presented in the article had been preserved in the original note\u2010 books. Although not targets of this comparison per se, the article figures (as opposed to numerical notebook data) had been produced either from the original Mathematica Postscript followed by some figure compositing, or by exporting numerical data for in\u2010 put to Cricket Graph (if memory serves\u2013 I can\u2019t read those figure files now.) All original and modified software described here has been made publicly available as a directory \u201crehydro\u201d on Zenodo. In preparing for the reproduction trials, the orig\u2010 inal notebooks were automatically converted using Mathematica v5.2 to an ascii for\u2010 mat. The 1995 notebooks generally contained additional code and results unrelated\nReScience C 6.1 (#4) \u2013 Robert 2020 2\n[Rp] Reproducibility report: Estimating friction coefficients of mixed globular/chain molecules, such as protein/DNA complexes. [Biophys J 69, 840-848 (1995)]\nto the article or to the present tests; all relevant code for each target was saved with the root filename addition \u201c_1995\u201d in the subdirectory \u201coriginals\u201d. Copies of these files, with added filename code \u201c_repro\u201d, were then used for all reproduction attempts and modified as necessary in order to obtain results for comparison. The original library notebook \u201cs6.1_1995.nb\u201d, modified as necessary to \u201cs6.1_repro.nb\u201d, plus a notebook \u201cex\u2010 tra.nb\u201d containing additional plotting functions, were stored as Mathematica 5.2 pack\u2010 ages with the suffix \u201c.m\u201d, and the \u201cGet\u201d command added to the top of the relevant note\u2010 books to execute them. Running notes: In order to run the \u201c_repro\u201d files, a symbolic link \u201dReScience\u201d pointing to the rehydro code directory was first placed in Mathematica\u2019s default working direc\u2010 tory (my home directory in this case). Also, for each target, in order to remove history\u2010 dependent effects, the kernel was restarted and all target notebook cells were evaluated (answering \u201cNo\u201d to the dialog proposing to evaluate initialization cells only).\n4 Results\n4.1 Calculations on reference assemblies (original Figure 2) The article\u2019s approach was validated by using it to calculate translational frictional co\u2010 efficients for two series of reference assemblies (points connected by solid lines in the figure). These were compared to exact values (black circles in the figure) and to values calculated using an existing approximation method (dotted lines). The original notebook contained all the necessary code to calculate the friction coeffi\u2010 cients of the reference assemblies as well as the numerical values plotted in the article. The friction coefficients calculated in this notebook were thus the targets for the repro\u2010 duction. For the present reproduction trials, the notebook executed without any errors or warn\u2010 ings. The calculated friction coefficients match those obtained in the original notebook, differing only in the default rounding (4 digits in the original notebook, 6 in the new notebook). A plot of the data made using Mathematica 12 is shown in Figure 1 for com\u2010 parison to Figure 2 in the original article. Friction coefficients in the sub\u201050 bp spacer range had been calculated separately and were not present in the original files.\nReScience C 6.1 (#4) \u2013 Robert 2020 3\n[Rp] Reproducibility report: Estimating friction coefficients of mixed globular/chain molecules, such as protein/DNA complexes.

[Biophys J 69, 840-848 (1995)]\nOnly the first involved the calculations directly, and all issues were minor and could be expected in any evolving language. One might note that a particular consequence of Mathematica\u2019s symbolic processing capabilities is that it will not automatically throw an error if a non\u2010numerical result results from a calculation. This is the case if a function has simply not been defined, as was the case in the last example discussed above. Mathematica will happily provide output consisting of the symbolic function namemixed with numerical values for other symbols. This behavior is obviously critical for symbolic manipulations, but it makes it more difficult to identify omitted function definitions. A more significant barrier came from my neglecting to add documentation for the de\u2010 pendencies of the notebook code on functions and definitions made in other notebooks. Mathematica pioneered the use of notebooks on the Macintosh in the 1980\u2019s, but it\u2019s only been in more recent years that notebook interfaces such as Jupyter have received widespread adoption, (e.g., Rule et al.5). When using notebooks for significant tasks, the problem of dependencies, or more generally, state, can be particularly dogging, as note\u2010 books implicitly encourage state to be established interactively, as opposed to program\u2010 matically. Despite being an early proponent, I could already see themadness notebooks could engender, and as a consequence even in the 1990s I made some efforts to organize my code and to perform rudimentary versioning. While incomplete, twenty\u2010five years later this allowed me to reconstruct the dependencies used for this article without too much effort. I only wish I had gone further and taken the time to employ resources such as packages already offered in Mathematica to do so. A vexing aspect of my 1990\u2019s code had nothing to do with Mathematica or notebooks in general: the liberal use of global variables. The notebooks were consistent, but coor\u2010 dinating several notebooks required chasing down each variable in different contexts. This adds a barrier to re\u2010using the code for other applications. Nevertheless, the calculations presented in the 1995 article could be reproduced, with some effort, in three different 2020 computing environments from the original code. One reason for this is the self\u2010consistency and continuity in the development of Mathe\u2010 matica itself, which began seven years before the target article\u2019s publication and contin\u2010 ues to this day. A second type of continuity that might be mentioned is that implied in developing this scientific subject over several years, alternating with other topics, which obliged me to document and modularize my own code (although the result was decidedly far from perfect!). A short\u2010term, one\u2010off project would perhaps have produced a very different result if I had to reproduce it 25 years later. Indeed, while it is clearly in no way opti\u2010 mal, seeing this code running in a modern environment encourages me to continue its development in light of mounting advances both in quantifying chromatin remodelling and in appreciating its biological importance.\n6 Acknowledgements\nThanks to Wolfram Research for making Mathematica available on the Raspberry Pi platform, which allowed me to test using version 12.0, to the French CNRS program 80|PRIME\u20102019 (Projet \u201cDECRYPTOR\u201d), andmore generally to the \u201cInitiative d\u2019Excellence\u201d program from the French State (Grants \u201cDYNAMO\u201d, ANR\u201011\u2010LABX\u20100011, and \u201cCACSICE\u201d, ANR\u201011\u2010EQPX\u20100008).
