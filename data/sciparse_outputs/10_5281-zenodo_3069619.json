Since ReScience published its first article1, things have been going steadily. We are still alive, independent and without a budget. In the meantime, we have published around 24 articles (mostly in computational neuroscience & computational ecology) and the initial editorial board has grown from around 10 to roughly 100 members (editors and reviewers), we have advertised ReScience at several conferences worldwide, gave some interviews2, and published an article introducing ReScience in PeerJ CS3. Based on our experience4 at managing the journal during these four years, we think that time is ripe for some changes.\nReScience C & ReScience X \u2014 The biggest and most visible change we would like to propose is to change the name of the journal \u201cReScience\u201d in favor of \u201cReScience C\u201d where the C stands for (c)omputational. This change would be necessary to have consistent naming with the upcoming creation of the \u201cReScience X\u201d journal that will be dedicated to e(x)perimental replications and co-directed by E.Roesch (University of Reading) and N.Rougier (University of Bordeaux). The name \u201cReScience\u201d would then be used for the name of a non-profit organization (that is yet to be created) for the two journals as well as future journals (such as the utopian CoScience3 or a future and tentative \u201cReScience T\u201d for theoretical science).\nAnewsubmission process \u2014 The current submissionprocess requires authors to fork, clone and branch the submission repository in order to write their article and to place code and data at the relevant places in the forked repository. Once done, authors have to push their changes and to make a pull request that is considered as a submission. This process is cumbersome for authors and has induced many troubles for editors as well once the article is accepted and ready to be published, mostly because of the complexity of the editing procedure. In order to make life easier for everyone, we greatly simplified the submission process for ReScience C and X. Authors are now responsible for getting a DOI for their code & data and only have to submit a PDF and ametadata file in a GitHub issue. We also provide Python programs that largely automate the subsequent editing process. We will still archive the submission on Zenodo but this archive will be made for the final PDF only. However, both the PDF and the Zenodo entry will contain all associated DOIs (data and code).\nA simplified publishing process \u2014 In ReScience, we have have been using a combination of markdown and pandoc for producing both the draft and the final version of all the published articles. This had worked reasonably well until it started to cause all kind of\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 K. Hinsen and N.P. Rougier, released under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Consequently, articles will be now submitted directly in PDF with accompanying metadata in a separate file using the YAML format (they were previously embedded in the markdown file). Once an article has been accepted, authors will be responsible for updating the metadata and for rebuilding the PDF if necessary. We could also consider using the Whedon API that helps with automating most of the editorial tasks for JOSS and JOSE. This will most probably require some tweaking because our publishing pipeline is a bit different.\nA new design \u2014 The combination of markdown and pandoc has also severely limited the layout and style possibilities for the article template and since we are switching to LATEX, this is the opportunity to propose a new design based on a more elegant style, using a new font stack5,6,7 (you are currently reading it). The goal is to have a subtle but strong identity with enhanced readability. Considering that articles will be mostly read on screen (as opposed to printed), we can benefit from a more ethereal style. Once this design will have stabilized, an overleaf template will bemade available for those without a TEX installation. If a TEX expert is ready to help review the template (and possibly rewrite it as a class), their help would be much welcome and appreciated. The same holds for LibreOffice, Word or Pages, any template is welcome, just contact us beforehand such that we can coordinate efforts.\nEditorials, letters and special issues \u2014 ReScience C remains dedicated to the publication of computational replications but we (i.e., the editorial team) would like to have the opportunity to publish editorials when deemed necessary and to give anyone the opportunity to write letters to the community on a specific topic related to reproducibility. Both editorials and letters are expected to be 1 or 2 pages long (but no hard limit will be enforced), will be (quickly) peer reviewed, and will be assigned a DOI. Furthermore, with the advent of reproducibility hackatonsworldwide, wewill host special issueswith guest editors (such as, for example, the organizers of a hackaton) in order to publish the results and to enhance their discoverability. Each entry will have to go through the regular open peer-reviewed pipeline.\nWe hope that most readers will agree on the proposed changes such that we can commit to them in the next few weeks. The review for this editorial is open (as usual) and anyone can comment on and/or oppose any of the proposed changes. New ideas are also welcome."}], "title": "ReScience (R)evolution", "year": 2019}
