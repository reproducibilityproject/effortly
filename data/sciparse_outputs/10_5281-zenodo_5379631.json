The main neuropathological hallmark of PD is the progressive accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in fibrillar aggregates named Lewy Bodies (in the soma) or Lewy Neurites (in neurites) [1]. Interestingly, Lewy pathology follows a predictable pattern of progression in the brain suggesting that \u03b1-synuclein can propagate from neurons to neurons [2]. Such observation, common tomany neurodegenerative diseases [3], prompted initiatives tomodel and predict pathology progression in the brain of patients with neurodegenerative disorders.\nIn 2012, Raj and colleagues developed a Network DiffusionModel (NDM) to predict atrophy progression in dementia [4]. For this purpose, they compared Magnetic Resonance Imaging acquisitions fromhealthy young subjects, healthy old subjects, and old patients suffering from either Frontotemporal Dementia or Alzheimer s\u0313 Disease. Their study suggested that patterns of atrophy within the dementia spectrum could be explained by transmission of the disease along neuronal pathways. Using their model, they demonstrated a path for predicting future atrophy in individuals starting from baseline. The NDM model was later applied to other diseases using various kinds of data. In 2017, Mezias and Raj showed in a mouse model that the spread of amyloid-\u03b2 pathology, involded in Alzheimer s\u0313 disease, was driven by spatial proximity but not network connectivity [5]. At the opposite, progression of tau pathology, also involved in Alzheimer s\u0313 disease and other tauopathies, was better recapitulated by connectivity [6]. In 2019, Henderson and colleagues reported that progression of \u03b1-synuclein pathology, similary to tau pathology, is largely predicted by anatomical connectivity between brain structures [7].\nWe here replicated the core of the NDM applied to \u03b1-synuclein spread in mice as implemented by Henderson and colleagues [7]. R scripts, connectivity matrix and experimental datasets were made fully accessible by the authors on GitHub allowing an easy process. We took inspiration from the original code in the way to build the connectivity\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 T.E. Paul and M.

It was then used as a tool to generate results and comparewith the Python implementation. In order to ease comparison between the two codes, we kept some function and variable names similar. Overall, we were able to reproduce qualitatively and quantitatively the main results of the publication. The aim of the present replication is not to fully replicate the entire paper but to focus on the core model and immediate results (shown in Figures 4 and 5 in the original paper).\n2 Background\n2.1 Graph Theory and brain connectivity Henderson et al. combined quantitative pathology mapping in the mouse brain with network modeling to understand the spatiotemporal pattern of spread of \u03b1-synuclein pathology [7]. Graph theory is a branch of mathematics applicable to Neuroscience. The brain is a complex system that can be modeled as a network or graph. When applied properly, Graph theory can offer important insights into different aspects of brain networks such as architecture, evolution, development, or clinical disorder [8].\nNetworks are defined as a collection of elements (or nodes) and their pairwise links (or edges) that can be summarized in the form of a connectivity matrix (named adjacency matrix). Depending on the type of graph, edges can have binary values (present: 1 - absent: 0) or actual weights reflecting connection strength. A graph is called undirected when an edge e reciprocally connects nodes Va and Vb. Conversely, a graph is named directed when the edge e is projecting from Va to Vb but not from Vb to Va.\nThanks to the initiative from the Allen Institute for Brain Science s\u0313 Mouse Connectivity Atlas (MCA), the mouse brain mesoscale connectome is now freely accessible for the neuroscience community [9]. In a matrix, connectivity is represented as \u201dincoming\u201d along rows and \u201doutgoing\u201d along columns. From the adjacency matrix, the in-degree and out-degree distributions can be computed as respectively the sum of all entries in the corresponding row and the sum of all entries in the corresponding column and are represented in diagonal matrices.\nThe Laplacian graph is a matrix used to explore the properties of a network. It is computed using the adjacency matrix and either the in-degree or out-degree graph depending on the applications.\n2.2 Model description The model used by Henderson et al. requires the mouse brain connectome (discussed in the previous section) and whole brain \u03b1-synuclein pathology quantification.\nThe experimental model of \u03b1-synuclein pathology propagation used in the study is the now classical \u03b1-synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs - 5\u00b5g) unilateral injection in the dorsal striatum of non-transgenic mice (NTG) [10, 7]. Following inoculation, NTG mice were terminated at 3, 6, or 9 months post-injection (MPI). Brain pathology was assessed using traditional immunohistochemical methods to detect \u03b1-synuclein phosphorylated on Serine129 (p-\u03b1-syn). Quantification (as percent of region occupied by immunostaining) was performed on both brain hemispheres (ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the injection point) in 58 different regions. Thus, the p-\u03b1-syn dataset provided by the authors on their repository is an CSV sheet with values for 5 mice per group and timepoint for all 116 brain regions.\nReScience C 7.1 (#8) \u2013 Paul and Bourdenx 2021 2\nUsing the dataset from [9] for synaptic connection, the authors generated a directed and weighed connectivity graph G = V,E whose nodes V are N cortical and subcortical grey matter regions and whose edges eij \u2208 E represent an axonal projection from Vi to Vj . They then defined the weighed adjacency matrix of G as A = [Aij ] generating a final parcellation of 116 regions.\nThe magnitude of the observed p-\u03b1-syn staining of all N nodes at a time t is the vector xt. The predicted regional p-\u03b1-syn x\u0302t is a function of the adjacency matrix A and a seed region seed (\u2208 E) and is computed as shown in (1):\nx\u0302t = e \u2212cLtxo (1)\nWhere:\n\u2022 c is a constant designed to achieve an optimalmatchwith the data as the empirical diffusion constant for the pathology is a priori unknown.\n\u2022 t stands for the timepoint of the prediction.\n\u2022 L is the out-degree Laplacian matrix computed as shown in (2):{ \u2212Aij for i \u0338= j\u2211N\nj=1 Aij for i = j (2)\n\u2022 x0 is the seed vector computed as shown in (3):\nx0 { 0 for i \u0338= seed 1 for i = seed\n(3)\n3 Material and Methods\nHenderson et al. coded their model using R andMATLAB. Codes and dataset weremade fully accessible on GitHub by the authors. In order to only rely on opensource and free tools, we decided to reproduce the model in Python 3. We looked for operating systems intercompability and ran our code successfully on both Microsoft Windows 10 and MacOS 11.2.3. Table 1 lists the required packages and their versions. Our code (and the associated datasets) is fully accessible in a GitHub repository https://github.com/MathieuBo/ PathoSpreading.\nReScience C 7.1 (#8) \u2013 Paul and Bourdenx 2021 3\n4 Results\n4.1 Network model of pathological \u03b1-synuclein spread The model comprises a single free parameter c, the seeds\u0313 diffusivity coefficient, that is used to scale the model to experimental results. The model is initiated by creating the seed vectorx0 for the inoculated region: here the caudoputamen (CPu). Then, themodel iterates over possible the values of c \u2208 [0, 10]. We selected the value of c that maximizes model fit, defined as the Pearsons\u0313 correlation r between log10 xt and log10 x\u0302t averaged over all timepoints. Table 2 summarizes the results including selected c value and correlation results. Correlation results for each timepoints are also plotted in Figure 1A-C (to be compared with Figure4a from the original article). Overall, we obtained a perfect replication, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of the original published results.\nThen, we performed some control experiments on the model to assess its robustness. First, as in the original article, we randomly seeded the diffusion model in all brain regions and calculated the value c. The \u02bctrue\u02bc seeded region (CPu) was among the best fits (97th percentile), at each timepoint (Figure 1D). Then, we implemented 2 additional controls: we randomly shuffled (over 150 iterations) the connectivity matrix (Figure 1E) and the p-\u03b1-syn matrix (Figure 1F), as in [11]. For each control experiment, we plotted the corresponding value of r. One can appreciate the profound performance loss in the different control experiments. Our results confirm that the spatiotemporal spread of pathological \u03b1-synuclein is driven by connectivity.\n4.2 Differential regional vulnerability is correlated with \u03b1-synuclein expression Intrinsic regional vulnerability is hypothesized to be a critical factor in the development of brain pathology related to \u03b1-synuclein or other pathogenic proteins [12]. Henderson et al. thought to investigate that aspect using the connectivity-based model. To do so, they used the difference between prediction and experiment (i.e. the residues of the linear regression) as a measure of relative vulnerability. Regions with higher p-\u03b1-syn staining than predicted were defined as vulnerable while the ones with lower values than predicted were considered resilient (Figure 2A). We here present an example at 6 months post-injection (Figure 2B). We used a \u02bclollipop\u02bc plot to help appreciate the distance to linear regression. Residues presented a bell shape-like distribution centered on 0 (Figure 2C). We plotted the vulnerability averaged over the 3 timepoints (Figure 2D). Similarly to the original article, we observed that anterior cortical regions (motor\nReScience C 7.1 (#8) \u2013 Paul and Bourdenx 2021 4\ncortex for example), the piriform cortex or the amygdalar region are highly vulnerable.\nTo determine whether model performance could be improved by the addition of other components, Henderson et al. seek out for factors that could contribute to regional vulnerability. An immediate assumption is that local levels of messenger-RNA (mRNA) encoding for \u03b1-synuclein could influence the future accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in aggregates. To directly test that hypothesis, the model was modified to account for regional levels of \u03b1-synuclein mRNA (Figure 2E) by direclty modifying the adjacency matrix A = S \u00d7 A, where S is the diagonal matrix of the vector R containing the regional levels of \u03b1-synuclein mRNA for each brain region of A such as:\nS = { Ri for i = j 0 otherwise\n(4)\nModel fitting andperformance estimation remained similar. Incorporation of\u03b1-synuclein trancript s\u0313 levels in the network diffusion model improved model performance by up 12% of added explained variance (Figure 2F-H). Here also, we perfectly replicated the original results both qualitatively (shown in Figure 2F-H) and quantitatively (shown in Table 3). Overall, these data suggest that SNCA gene expression is an important factor impacting the vulnerability of regions and subsequently pathology spread.\nReScience C 7.1 (#8) \u2013 Paul and Bourdenx 2021 5\n4.3 In silico seeding of alternative regions To examine the generalizability of themodel (i.e. the ability to apply to other conditions), Henderson et al. proceeded to in silico seeding of alternative regions such as the Piriform Cortex (Pir) and the Substantia Nigra (SN). Figure 3 displays the p-\u03b1-syn spread at 1, 3 and 6 month(s) post-injection after seeding the model with either the Pir or the SN. We successfully obtained similar predictions after seeding in either the Pir or the SN. In silico injection in the Pir remarkably corresponds to previous semi-quantitative p-\u03b1-syn grading study [14] (Figure 3A). On the other hand, in silico injection in the SN resulted in slow propagation through the nigrostrial tract to first the caudoputamen and then to cortical regions (Figure 3B). The observed pattern following SN injection mimicks previous experimental results and the staging of human cases [2, 15, 16]. Taken together, these findings support the ability of the Diffusion Network model to generalize data predictions.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this article, we successfully replicated the computational model created by Henderson et al. [7] in Python.\nTheNetwork DiffusionModel initially developed by Raj et al. [4] and recently adapted by Henderson et al. [7] is a powerful tool to understand the spread of p-\u03b1-syn in the brain. In its initial form, the model is solely based on anatomical connectivity between brain regions. Despite its simplicity, the model is able to predict 31% to 47% of the total variance. In a second version, the endogenous \u03b1-synuclein expression (at the mRNA level) is added to the model. The addition improves model performance (up to 12% of added explained variance), although a quantitative analysis should be performed in the future.\nSimilarly to what is observed in preclinical models of synucleinopathies or in the brain of Parkinsons\u0313 disease s\u0313 patients, \u03b1-synuclein pathology is composed of \u02bcislands\u02bc of vulnerable neurons susceptible to developing pathogenic protein inclusions. By comparing the observed and predicted p-\u03b1-syn staining based on anatomical connectivity, the model allows to explore regional vulnerability. Finally, seeding in different regions such as the Pir and the SN supports the network diffusion model generalizability. Overall, this model is attractive as it is simple, easily handled, and replicable.\nReScience C 7.1 (#8) \u2013 Paul and Bourdenx 2021 6\nNonetheless, the model is not without limitations. Other experimental datasets (investigating other seeding regions or using alternative markers for pathological \u03b1-synuclein) are still required to quantitatively assess the ability of the model to generalize the prediction of \u03b1-synuclein spread. Another barrier comes from the available connectivity data [9]. The connectivity matrix used by Henderson et al. and ourselves is at the mesoscale. One implication, for example, is that brain structures are considered homogenous, hence not taking into account the laminar cortical organization for example. The observation of a distinct distribution of the \u03b1-synuclein pathology in cortical layer suggests that lower scale connectivity data could help to capture overlooked events.\nModeling disease propagation in the brain is challenging and often reductionist per se. Indeed, during the course of disease, the brain changes according to at least two parallel processes: the \u201dDynamics On Network\u201d and the \u201dDynamics Of Network\u201d [17]. The first one is related to processes that occur atop a static structure as, for instance, \u03b1-synuclein spread. The second defines the brain network changes over time (e.g. neurodegeneration or extracellular remodelling [18]). A major challenge remains in modeling both these \u201don\u201d and \u201dof\u201d dynamics. If we were only to understand one dynamic and leave the other dynamic unexplored, we could imagine to still be a step away from the reality of the pathology.\n6 Acknowledgements\nWe thank Dr. Erwan Bezard and Dr. Benjamin Dehay for helpful discussion.
