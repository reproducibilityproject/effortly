In a previous study [1] we had explored the ecological and carbon\u2010cycle consequences of changes in the fire regime using an ecosystem model run at high resolution across a large (1000 km x 1000 km) area of the central Canadian boreal forest. In a subsequent paper [2], we used the same model outputs to examine the hydrological implications of these wildfire regime shifts [3].\nHow reproducible are the results reported in Bond\u2010Lamberty et al. 2009? The article manuscript was written in 2007\u20102008, initially submitted in April 2008, and a final, re\u2010 vised versionwas submitted in October of that year. The system timestamp on the script output file is 2008\u201003\u201016. Themethods section reports that R 2.6.0 [4], whichwas released on 2007\u201010\u201003, was used for all analyses. The source code was not publicly archived, but retained in the lead author\u2019s personal records; it has no license. The original hardware would have been an Apple laptop (probably a 2006\u20102007 MacBook Pro). As noted above, the code file was archived by the lead author, and so was easy for him (but no one else) to find. The code has no comments or instructions.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Retrieval of the software The source code being reproduced here is short and was written to analyze relation\u2010 ships between various potential driving factors and three output variables of interest:\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 B.

The code simply reads in a comma\u2010separated data file holding themodeling outputs, prints a summary of the data, and then fits and prints 12 separate regressions (three output variables times four possible independent variables). These fit statistics were reported on p. 1247 of Bond\u2010Lamberty et al. 2009.\n2.2 Execution Because the code uses only base R functions, it has no dependencies other than a stan\u2010 dard R installation. Both in 2007\u20102008 and 2020, the default Mac R installer provided by CRAN was used to install R (i.e. it was not built from source). The code was re\u2010 run, without modification, on a 2018 MacBook Pro under R version 3.6.1 (2019\u201007\u201005) [5]; platform: x86\\_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64\u2010bit); running under macOS Mo\u2010 jave 10.14.6. Its output was then compared with the printed output from the 2007\u20102008 R 2.6.0 code, which had been recorded via R\u2019s sink() function and archived with the code.\n3 Results and discussion\nSetting asideminor spacing and text capitalization changes, only one numerical change occurred, albeit in the sixth decimal place. In the 2008 R 2.6.0 output of a linear regres\u2010 sion between canopy evaporation (dependent variable) and precipitation (independent), the residuals were given as:"}, {"heading": "Residuals:", "text": "Min 1Q Median 3Q Max\n-0.028858 -0.009186 0.002088 0.010753 0.019997\nIn the 2020 R 3.6.0 output, this output line (specifically, the \u201dMedian\u201d value) was:"}, {"heading": "Residuals:", "text": "Min 1Q Median 3Q Max\n-0.028858 -0.009186 0.002089 0.010753 0.019997\nIn addition, in two cases p\u2010values were reported with a different number of significant digits in the 2020 output: once gaining a digit (\u201d0.005451\u201d in 2020 versus \u201d0.00545\u201d in 2008) and once losing one (\u201d0.000103\u201d and 0.0001030\u201d respectively). No other numerical differences occurred.\nWhether these minor differences were due to the different R version, or different under\u2010 lying operating system and/or libraries, is uncertain. R version 2.6.0 (https://cran.r-project. org/bin/macosx/old/R-2.6.0.dmg) is unfortunately not installable under modern versions of macOS. Instead I downloaded R 2.6.0 for Windows (i386-pc-mingw32) and ran the code on it; the printed results were identical to the 2007\u20102008 output file. This suggests that the minor differences noted above between the R 2.6.0 and 3.6.0 outputs were due to changes in R itself, not differences in the underlying systems.\nAs simple as the code and this reproducibility exercise was, there are some interesting notes that can be drawn from it. Reproducibility has been a well\u2010supported (see e.g. https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html) core value of the R Core Team and larger communnity, and the base version of the software has been highly stable over the last twenty years since version 1.0. Specifically with regard to this exercise, the core of the \u2018lm\u2018 (linear model) source code, found at https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/ stats/R/lm.R, has changed little over the last decade. Refinements and extensions to R\u2019s linear modeling capabilities have instead come from contributed packages [6].\nReScience C 6.1 (#21) \u2013 Bond-Lamberty 2021 2\nIn contrast, many of the most highly used R packages, for example those of the popular tidyverse ecosystem [7] have historically changed their behavior and syntax much more frequently. This allows for faster evolution and cleaner, consistent syntax (not among base R\u2019s strong points) but poses greater challenges for stable and reproducible software. For example, the popular dplyr package lists (see https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/ master/NEWS.md) breaking changes introduced at versions 0.5, 0.7, 0.7.5, 0.8, 0.8.1, and 1.0, over a timespan of four years; it seems unlikely that code taking advantage of its powerful features and speed would be reproducible without being tweaked or rewritten. This highlights some of the challenges surrounding computational reproducibility [8, 9], in particular balancing reproducibility with other potentially important criteria such as performance or confidentiality [10, 11].\n4 Conclusions\nThereweremanypotential limitations in reproducing even this very short analysis script over ten years later: the code contained no documentation about R or package versions, nor information about the hardware information it was originally run on. The analysis date could only be reconstructed from the output file timestamp (luckily unaltered). Sav\u2010 ing this output file, however, at least allowed for a robust check on the reproducibility of the analysis, script, and underlying R software after 12 years. The essentially successful result is due to the relative simplicity of the script, its use of only base R functions, and R\u2019s conservative approach to breaking changes."}], "title": "[Re] Drivers of evapotranspiration from boreal wildfires", "year": 2021}
