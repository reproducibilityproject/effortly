Vertical transmission is the direct transfer of a par\u2010 asite from one generation to the next during reproduction. Horizontal transmission is the transmission of parasites among related and non\u2010related individuals alike, and can be passed on at any time in the hosts\u2019 life cycle1. Horizontal transmission can occur di\u2010 rectly, such as through air\u2010borne, food\u2010borne or sexual infections, or indirectly through a vector2. It has been suggested that these different modes of transmission play a cru\u2010 cial role in determining the virulence of a pathogen3,4, which reflects its ability to cause disease5. The transmission process thus determines the spread and persistence of a given pathogen in a population, which is crucial to modeling population dynamics and designing proper disease control strategies. In 1987, Ewald6 theorized that parasites with predominantly horizontal transmission would tend towards higher virulence, whereas those with vertical transmission would tend towards lower virulence. However, Lipsitch et al. (1996)7 observed that increased horizontal transmission actually selects for lower virulence and greater vertical trans\u2010 mission in pathogens instead. This occurs because of epidemiological feedback: higher contact rates between hosts allow for a greater number of equilibrium states to be at\u2010 tained, where high horizontal transmission is not effective8. This enables strains with lower basic reproductive ratios and vertical transmission to exclude, through competi\u2010 tion, those with higher reproductive ratios and horizontal transmission. In this study, we successfully replicate the epidemiological model incorporating trade\u2010 offs between vertical and horizontal transmission from the original study by Lipsitch et al. (1996)7 using their methods and parameters. This study is foundational in the field of evolutionary epidemiology, in that it challenged the notion that vertical transmission only was able to lower the evolutionarily stable (ESS) level of virulence, which was the\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 F.

We observe the dynamics between 1 host population and 100 infected strains added individually every 103 time steps for a total of 105 itera\u2010 tions. Thismodel gives the host population time to stabilize and adapt to the exposure to various pathogens between each transmission opportunity. Different simulations sup\u2010 port the idea that vertical transmission is favoured over horizontal transmission in cases of decreased virulence, thus selecting for strains with low virulence. Furthermore, we find that as the number of opportunities for horizontal transmission increase, selection for strains with lower virulence also increases, given that infection is only allowed for one pathogenic strain at a time. Lastly, we present additional simulations in which each strain\u2019s properties may evolve through time, thus imitating further realistic conditions. This study was conducted using version 1.6.0 of the Julia programming language.\n2 Mathematical Model for the Evolution of Virulence\nWe start by considering a model composed of one uninfected host population and two populations infected with either of two pathogenic strains. This model is a generaliza\u2010 tion of Lipsitch et al. (1996)7 single\u2010strain model and its dynamics are governed by the following equations:\ndX\ndt = (bxX + e1Y1 + e2Y2)(1\u2212 X + Y1 + Y2 K )\u2212 uxX \u2212 cX(\u03b21Y1 + \u03b22Y2) (1)\ndY1 dt = b1Y1(1\u2212 X + Y1 + Y2 K )\u2212 u1Y1 + c\u03b21XY1 (2)\ndY2 dt = b2Y2(1\u2212 X + Y1 + Y2 K )\u2212 u2Y2 + c\u03b22XY2 (3)\nLet X be the number of uninfected hosts and Yi the number of infected hosts with pathogen strains i = 1, 2. Uninfected hosts have a maximal per capita birth rate bx and a mortality rate ux, resulting in a lifespan of ( 1ux ). Let ei represent the per capita birth rate of uninfected hosts by hosts infected with strain i and bi represent the per capita birth rate of offspring infected with strain i per unit time. Infected hosts die at the rate ui \u2265 ux. Let c be the rate of contact between hosts (i.e. the opportunities for horizon\u2010 tal transmission) and \u03b2i the rate of horizontal transmission of strain i. Finally, let K represent the environment\u2019s carrying capacity. For each strain to invade and persist in the population, the basic reproductive rate of the parasite must be greater than 1 and satisfy the following conditions:\nR0 = H0 + V0 > 1 (4)\nH0 = c\u03b2i ui K(1\u2212 ux bx ) (5)\nV0 = biux bxui\n(6)\nWhere H0 represents the number of new horizontally\u2010acquired cases from a single in\u2010 fected host in a population of uninfected hosts before the primary host dies and V0 rep\u2010 resents the number of new vertically\u2010acquired cases by the same host introduced into the uninfected population at equilibrium. Generalizing this two\u2010pathogen model to i strains allows for the study of more complex dynamics, such as in this epidemiological model replication.\nReScience C 7.1 (#10) \u2013 Dhane et al. 2021 2\n2.1 Justification of Parameters Most parameters used in this study are identical to those in the original study. The ini\u2010 tial number of uninfected and infected hosts with strain 1 are of X0 = 80 and Y1.0 = 1, respectively. We inferred the former from the figures in the original article, since this value was not explicitly mentioned in the text. For the host population, its birth rate bx is held constant at 1.0, while its mortality rate ux is held constant at 0.2. For plotting purposes, we set the carrying capacityK = 100 to simulate whole numbers instead of proportions for panels (a,b) of our figures. Also, the values presented in Fig\u2010 ures 1\u20103 comprise of weighted values forR0, V0, ux, \u03b2i and virulence for noise reduction. We set the value of K = 1 in panels (c,d) to simplify the calculation of R0. Finally, we plot the evenness of the total population in panels (i,j) of each figure in order to relate it to the evolutionary dynamics of each simulation. The values for variables c, bi, ei and ui vary between strains and figures in order to compare their different impacts on the epidemiological evolutionary trajectories. The horizontal transmission rate and virulence of each strain are respectively constrained by the following equations:\n\u03b2i(ui) = 3(ui \u2212 ux) ui \u2212 ux + 1\n(7)\nV irulence = 1\u2212 (bi + ei)ux bxui\n(8)\nEquation (7) defines themonotonically increasing relationshipbetweendisease\u2010induced mortality rates ui \u2010 ux and horizontal transmissibility. On the other hand, equation (8) defines virulence (ranging from 0 to 1) as the proportional fitness loss of an infected host, where lower virulence equates lower mean mortality.\n2.2 Figure 1 We compare the evolutionary trajectories with the variable bi held constant at the values of 0.1 and 1.0 for every pathogenic strain (thereby calling it a generalized by) in their respective column. Since the number of infected offspring from an infected host ei directly depends on bi through the equation ei = bx \u2212 bi, each strain also possesses an ei value of 0.9 and 0.0, in each respective case.\n2.3 Figure 2 We present the evolutionary trajectories with additional variables r1, r2 and r3. Their values are randomly sampled on a uniform distribution over [0,1] for each strain in or\u2010 der to add stochasticity to the model. They respectively designate the total virulence of the strain, the fraction of virulence attributable to fecundity loss, and the fraction of offspring of infected hosts which are infected. The resulting constraints on the simula\u2010 tions\u2019 parameters are the following:\nei = bx(1\u2212 r3)(1\u2212 r1r2) (9)\nbi = bxr3(1\u2212 r1r2) (10)\n\u03b2i = r1 \u2212 \u03b1bi bx\n(11)\nEquation 9mathematically depicts that the birth rate of uninfected offspring by infected hosts ei is equal to themaximal per capita birth rate bx multiplied by the fraction of unin\u2010 fected offspring (1 \u2010 r3) minus the fecundity loss due to virulence (1 \u2010 r1 r2). Equation 10\nReScience C 7.1 (#10) \u2013 Dhane et al. 2021 3\nReScience C 7.1 (#10) \u2013 Dhane et al. 2021 4\nshows that the birth rate of infected offspring bi is equal to the maximal per capita birth rate bx multiplied the fraction of infected offspring r3 minus this same loss. Finally, equation 11 reveals that the rate of horizontal transmission \u03b2i is equal to the total viru\u2010 lence r1 minus the cost of vertical transmission in relation to horizontal transmission \u03b1 multiplied by the fraction of infected births bi/bx. We set the parameter \u03b1 as a random value over [0,1] for each strain, introducing a cost\u2010benefit trade\u2010off between vertical and horizontal modes of transmission on parasite fitness. We ensure non\u2010negative horizon\u2010 tal transmission values by setting \u03b2i to zero if the second term happens to be greater than the first term by chance.\n2.4 Figure 3 We show the evolutionary trajectories where both vertical and horizontal transmission parameters can vary with a constraint. All parameters are identical to those in Figure 2, with the exception of r3 restricted by the range [0, r1] such that the fraction of infected offspring from infected hosts may not exceed the total virulence.\n3 Discussion\n3.1 Parameter Constraints In Figure 1, we replicate the evolutionary trajectories for two different values of vertical transmission, by = 0.1 and 1.0, which are held constant for all strains. This scenario represents a case of imperfect vertical transmission such that there is no net loss of fertility due to infection. In other words, virulence (i.e. the loss of fitness of the host) depends solely onmortality through equation (8); we thus neglect the decrease in fitness from the reduction of the number of uninfected offspring. In the following two figures, we replicate simulations of the evolutionary dynamics with varying vertical and horizontal parameters under constraints through equations (9\u201011). In Figure 2, strains are permitted to have very low virulence and very high vertical trans\u2010 mission (through random variables r1, r2, r3 and \u03b1). This state is typically seen in the evolution of avirulence. In Figure 3, high levels of vertical transmission are only per\u2010 mitted with high levels of virulence through the r3 \u2208 [0,r1] restriction. This is typically associated with pathogens that require sufficient replication within the host, usually resulting in the harming of the host.\n3.2 Analysis of Results As shown in Figure 1, different parasitic strains persist due to coexistence and compet\u2010 itive exclusion, which varies in degree at every new generation. Similarly to the results observed by Lipsitch et al. (1996)7, higher vertical transmission selects for lower mortal\u2010 ity, horizontal transmission andR0. This indicates a lesser importance of the horizontal transmission parameter, in the case where there is a higher vertical transmission rate; this represents a situation inwhich the population is saturatedwith individuals infected by pathogens with high vertical transmission and low virulence. Additionally, lower vir\u2010 ulence results in lower meanmortality through equation 8 and as observed in panels (g, h). Panels (i,j) describe the evenness of the total population, which is observed to re\u2010 main at low values in both situations. Because of the high reproductive rate (R0 > 1), a small number of strains occupy the majority of the population, while close to no hosts remain uninfected. Figure 2 shows the evolutionary trajectories where high vertical transmission is compat\u2010 ible with low virulence. Two cases with identical parameters except for the rate of con\u2010 tact between hosts, c = 0.5 and c = 4.0, are presented. As predicted in the original study, an increase in the contact rate selects for less virulent strains exhibiting high vertical\nReScience C 7.1 (#10) \u2013 Dhane et al. 2021 5\nReScience C 7.1 (#10) \u2013 Dhane et al. 2021 6\nReScience C 7.1 (#10) \u2013 Dhane et al. 2021 7\ntransmission rates. This can be explained by the fact that as the number of contacts be\u2010 tween individuals increases, the number of available susceptible individuals decreases, leading to saturation. Figure 3 describes an equilibrium similar to that of Figure 2, but with increases in vir\u2010 ulence. This can be explained through the limit on vertical transmission (through the constraint r3 \u2208 [0,r1] and the low rate of horizontal transmission, which is directly cor\u2010 related to the contact rate (c = 0.5). Equation 4 confirms this observation, where the invasion and persistence of a parasite can only occur when the sum of H0 and V0 is greater than 1. Selection thus favours parasites exhibiting relatively high virulence and employing horizontal transmission. As previously described, the fraction of infected offspring from infected hosts, and thus vertical transmission, is limited by the total vir\u2010 ulence of the strain. This constraint results in the mean V0 barely attaining a vertical basic reproductive ratio of 0.2, thus demonstrating the limited fitness benefit conferred by vertical transmission. We therefore confirm the results from Lipsitch et al. (1996)7, where horizontal transmission is less virulent than vertical transmission. Our simula\u2010 tions show that natural selection will always select for strains of lower virulence, which explains the decrease in virulence shown in panels (g,h). In Figures 2 and 3, selection for the type of transmission will depend on whether high vertical transmission is limited by virulence. When there is a competition between both transmission types, there will always be selection for the type that guarantees greater host fitness. And as seen in Ebert and Bull (2003), vertically\u2010transmitted strains are less virulent than horizontally\u2010transmitted ones. A horizontally\u2010transmitted strain will al\u2010 ways push the host to invest its energy in contact rather than reproduction, while verti\u2010 cal transmission ensures the opposite. A less virulent strain using vertical transmission provides the host with greater fitness than a very virulent strain using horizontal trans\u2010 mission, which therefore guarantees its persistence in the population over time. This dynamic is reflected in the relationship between virulence and the type of transmis\u2010 sion9. However, in the case where high vertical transmission requires high virulence, horizontally\u2010transmitted pathogens would prevail because of the low fitness benefits from vertical transmission.\n3.3 Other Remarks In this replication study, we observe fewer variation and trade\u2010offs between compet\u2010 ing strains in panels (a,b) of Figures 1\u20103, since the infected persist faster and certain dominant strains take over the entire population for the remainder of the simulations. We also notice generally lower R0 and V0 values than expected from the simulations in Lipsitch et al. (1996)7. This could be attributed to the variability induced by the four random variables r1, r2, r3 and \u03b1 (where the latter in particular was chosen as a random value over [0,1] per strain due to a lack of information in the original study) or to poten\u2010 tially different initial numbers of individuals (which were also arbitrarily chosen due to their values not being explicitly mentioned in the text). It could also be explained by the differences in duration of the simulations; this replication was done on a smaller scale, with ten times less strains, such that the probability of one random strain overcoming the one with the highest fitness is reduced by a factor of ten. Finally, we note that the population evenness is inversely related to the presence of dominant strains; very few strains monopolizing the population result in low evenness, whereas multiple strains co\u2010existing result in a population exhibiting higher evenness. Panels (i,j) of each figure depict the expected dynamics in such cases.\n3.4 Conclusion Few models consider the evolution of virulence for parasites with mixed horizontal and vertical transmission. Here, our results are similar to the findings of Lipsitch et al. (1996)7, suggesting that selection depends on whether high vertical transmission rates\nReScience C 7.1 (#10) \u2013 Dhane et al. 2021 8\nare constrained by low or high virulence. Similarly, we observed that selection favours vertically\u2010transmitted strains, but only when vertical transmission is compatible with low virulence. On the other hand, in situations where high vertical transmission rates are only possible with high virulence, horizontal transmission is favoured. Ultimately, selection will always favour the least virulent strain, regardless of the type of transmis\u2010 sion. These findings could suggest that efforts to reduce vertical transmission of pathogens could, unintentionally, shift selection towards mutants of increased virulence. It is pos\u2010 sible that vertical transmission has placed a selection pressure on pathogens to evolve at relatively low levels of virulence, thereby allowing the mother\u2010to\u2010offspring chain of transmission to continue over several generations. However, in caseswhere the horizon\u2010 tal transmission rates are also low, reducing vertical transmission might be sufficient to eliminate a pathogen from a population by bringing its basic reproductive ratio below unity."}], "title": "[Re] The Evolution of Virulence in Pathogens with Vertical and Horizontal Transmission", "year": 2021}
