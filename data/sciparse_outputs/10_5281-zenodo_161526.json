In the original model, the majority of parameters are given per unit membrane surface area. For simplicity, we combine these parameters with the surface areas of the corresponding compartments in the following description. The resulting parameters are denoted with a tilde.\nThe model for excitatory neurons contains a somatic and a dendritic compartment. The somatic compartment includes fast Na+ and K+ spiking currents (I\u0303Na, I\u0303K), a\nReScience | rescience.github.io 1 October 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nleak current I\u0303L, a fast A-type K+ current I\u0303A, a non-inactivating slow K+ current I\u0303KS, and a Na+-dependent K+ current I\u0303KNa. The dendritic compartment includes a highthreshold Ca2+ current I\u0303Ca, a Ca2+-dependent K+ current I\u0303KCa, a non-inactivating (persistent) Na+ current I\u0303NaP, and an inward rectifier (activated by hyperpolarization) non-inactivating K+ current I\u0303AR. Somato-dendritic coupling is implemented through the axial dendritic conductance gsd. Non-synaptic currents are modeled using the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism I\u0303 (t) = g\u0303mkhl (V \u2212 Erev), where gating variables m and h are calculated using a first-order activation scheme, dxdt = \u03d5 [\u03b1 (V ) (1\u2212 x)\u2212 \u03b2 (V )x] = (x\u221e (V )\u2212 x) /\u03c4 (V ) with x\u221e = \u03b1\u03b1+\u03b2 , \u03c4 = 1 \u03d5(\u03b1+\u03b2) , and \u03d5 being the temperature factor (constant). In cases where time dependence is neglected (due to rapid activation or inactivation), gating variables are substituted by their saturation levels m\u221e or h\u221e. The concentration of intrinsic neuronal Ca2+ and Na+ ions (in mM) is drawn from firstorder differential equations d[Ca\n2+] dt = \u03b1CaI\u0303Ca \u2212\n[ Ca2+ ] /\u03c4Ca and d[Na+] dt = \u03b1Na(I\u0303Na +\nI\u0303NaP)\u2212Rpump ( [Na+]3 / ( [Na+]3 + 153 ) \u2212 [Na+]3eq / ( [Na+]3eq + 153 )) where \u03b1Ca, \u03b1Na, \u03c4Ca, Rpump, [Na+]eq are constants. The model for inhibitory neurons just consists of a somatic compartment with only I\u0303Na, I\u0303K, and I\u0303L currents. AMPA and NMDA synaptic inputs target the dendritic compartment for excitatory and the somatic compartment for inhibitory neurons. GABA inputs always target the somatic compartment.\nBecause of the complexity of the single-neuron model (with multiple voltagedependent channels), we verify that our implementation behaves like the original according to the information given in the paper. Similar to the original work, 500ms injection of 250pA current into the soma (Fig. 1) results in an adapting firing pattern in pyramidal (PY) and non-adapting firing in fast-spiking (FS) neurons with average firing rates of 22 and 76 spikes/s, respectively. Distribution of the membrane leak conductance with 10% (PY) and 2.5% (FS) standard deviation around the mean value leads to a small fraction of PY and a negligible fraction of FS neurons showing spontaneous activity.\nThe notable difference in our implementation is the synaptic kinetics. In the original model, synaptic gating variables depend on the presynaptic membrane potential. Implementing such a dependence is at present highly nontrivial in NEST due to optimizations for distributed computing (see Kunkel et al. [8], Hahne et al. [6] for background). For this reason, we simplify the synapse models while preserving the amplitude and shape of postsynaptic conductances. Specifically, the first-order kinetics of AMPA and GABA channels is replaced by a simple exponential decay \u2202g\u2202t =\u2211 i W\u03b4 (t\u2212 ti)\u2212 g\u03c4 , where g is the synaptic conductance, \u03c4 is the synaptic decay time, W is the synaptic weight, and i indexes the incoming spike times. The second-order kinetics of NMDA channels is substituted by a difference of slow and fast exponential\nReScience | rescience.github.io 2 October 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\ncomponents, gNMDA = gNMDAslow \u2212 gNMDAfast with dgslow/fast dt = \u2211 i W\u03b4 (t\u2212 ti) \u2212 gslow/fast \u03c4slow/fast . These simplifications are justified by the stereotyped trajectory of the presynaptic membrane potential during an action potential. Further, these simplifications allow us to merge gating variables s of all synapses of one type (AMPA, NMDA or GABA) into a single postsynaptic time-dependent conductance (see Table 6). While multiple activations of the same synapse lead to linear summation of postsynaptic AMPA and GABA conductances in the original model, NMDA conductances saturate at high input rates. We model such behavior using the short-term plasticity formalism suggested by [11]. In short, the amplitude of the postsynaptic current PSC = A \u00b7R \u00b7 u is proportional to the fraction of available synaptic efficacy R and utilization of synaptic efficacy u. Spike-triggered synaptic activation leads to a reduction of the available synaptic efficacy (corresponding to short-term depression) together with an increase in the utilization of synaptic efficacy (corresponding to short-term facilitation). In the time period \u2206t between subsequent spikes, R and u recover to corresponding resting-state values (R0 = 1 and u0 = U) with time constants \u03c4rec and \u03c4facil. Our implementation closely follows the behavior of the original synapse model (Fig. 2). Note that the equation describing the dynamics of the NMDA gating variable s in the original paper contains a misprint and should read\nds dt = \u03b1(1\u2212 s)x\u2212 s/\u03c4. (1)\nThe network architecture represents a chain of excitatory and inhibitory neurons\nReScience | rescience.github.io 3 October 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\n(of length lchain) equidistantly distributed over 5mm. Each neuron projects a given total number (drawn from a Gaussian distribution) of outgoing connections. The probability of a connection between any two neurons decays with inter-neuronal distance according to a Gaussian P (x) = exp(\u2212 x22\u03bb2 )/ \u221a 2\u03c0\u03bb2 with characteristic scales \u03bbe and \u03bbi for excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic neuron types, respectively. Excitatory connections include both AMPA and NMDA channels, while inhibitory connections use GABA channels. Multiple connections can exist for a given pair of neurons. In Tables 1\u20137 we provide the description of the model.\nThe simulations are performed with NEST 2.8.0 [3] and combine an adaptive step size for the single-neuron solver with communication between neurons at a step size of 0.1ms. The time resolution of all recordings is 0.1ms.\nIn Fig. 6E excitatory and inhibitory conductances are filtered with a 40ms rectangular kernel. This kernel width is chosen to yield average input levels, rather than individual synaptic events. We find that filtering is required to reproduce the proportionality of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, shown in the original Figure 6, although no corresponding information is given in the original paper.\nTo estimate the neuronal membrane conductance according to Eq. 3 in the model at a time t0 near the membrane potential V0, we use a procedure we refer to as the \u201cvirtual hyperpolarization method\u201d (schematically shown in Fig. 3). First, an isolated copy of a neuron model instance is created with its state identical to that of the original neuron at the time of interest t0. Then, the neuron is allowed to relax to its equilibrium state, while being clamped to the corresponding membrane potential V0. In this steadystate configuration, the total cross-membrane current I0 is calculated as the sum of all channel currents according to Eq. 4. Then the neuron is slightly hyperpolarized to potential V1 and the corresponding steady-state current I1 is calculated. The ratio \u2206I/\u2206V then gives an estimate of the membrane conductance at time t0. This approach can be applied to the case where the membrane is approximately isopotential across the whole neuron (true for the present model). In case of more complex non-isopotential multi-compartment neurons, the corresponding equilibrium currents I0 and I1 should be estimated through direct simulation. Note that during this procedure the state of the synaptic input should be fixed at the level of time t0.\nThe relaxation time constant of certain ion concentrations (e.g., 80\u2013350ms for intracellular Ca2+ [10], [12]) can be much larger than the membrane time constant (on average <20ms at rest, e.g., [9]) in cortical neurons. Therefore, the typical duration of DC pulse injection (\u223c80 ms [2], [13]) used in experiments with active networks is enough to overcome the transient phase of prominent capacitive currents, while certain ion concentrations might be not equilibrated. In the present model, however, the membrane relaxation time constant reaches hundreds of milliseconds (see relaxation phase in Fig. 8), which makes it difficult to separate these two effects. Therefore, in our application of the virtual hyperpolarization method to the model we consider limit cases of both instantaneous (frozen) and equilibrated ion concentrations.\nReScience | rescience.github.io 4 October 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1"}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "We here focus on the main activity regime of the model, namely Up-Down oscillations that are either spontaneously generated or induced by stimulation. First, we simulate the reimplemented model with the parameters corresponding to the original paper. The simulated activity, however, is characterized by unreasonably high firing rates due to the dominance of NMDA conductances far exceeding the potency of the opposing GABAergic inhibition. This difference from the original results might be a consequence of the different implementation of synaptic dynamics. Closer examination of the original Figure 5C suggests that unitary excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses are approximately 0.5nS during periods of network silence. This contradicts our implementation of the non-modified synaptic dynamics (see Fig. 2), where single synaptic activations (with synaptic weights as in the original model) would result in 5.4 and 0.8nS postsynaptic response for AMPA and GABA channels, respectively. This suggests an inconsistency between the reported dynamics and that which was implemented already in the original work. Furthermore, we assumed the units of the function defining the dependence of the synaptic conductances on the presynaptic\nReScience | rescience.github.io 10 October 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nmembrane potential to be ms\u22121, but this is not strictly specified in the original work, providing another potential source of discrepancies.\nTo achieve an appropriate network regime, we modify the synaptic strengths W of all synapse types. Specifically, we match the firing rates, the duration of Up and Down states, the wave propagation speed, and the response to network stimulation. Corresponding synaptic strengths for the model with simplified synaptic dynamics are given in Table 6. When transformed back to the original implementation (i.e., excluding the synaptic gating variable s), the modified strengths are gAMPAee = 6.6nS, gNMDAee = 0.1nS, gAMPAei = 2.8nS, gNMDAei = 0 nS, gGABAie = 97 nS, gGABAii = 12 nS. However, a range of different synaptic weight settings was able to produce qualitatively identical network activity. Therefore, we chose a set of weights from among these possibilities based on relative proximity to the originally reported weight values. Besides the reasons mentioned above, differences between the simplified and original synaptic kinetics during network activity, not brought out by the simple inputs in Fig. 2, may contribute to the need for weight changes to obtain a network state similar to that in the original study. However, this is unlikely to account for the need to strongly increase the inhibitory weights relative to the excitatory ones. In the absence of the original code and since our network implementation does not allow using the original synapse dynamics, we cannot resolve this issue here.\nThe adjusted weights result in periods of spontaneously generated activity (Up states) which propagate along the network in a wave-like fashion (Fig. 4A) with propagation speed 3 \u2212 7mm/s. On the level of individual neurons, Up states are characterized by a depolarized membrane potential and an increase of the intracellular concentration of Na+ ions by 3\u20134.5mM (Fig. 4C,D for two neurons), similar to the results shown in Figure 2 of the original work. When excitatory neurons are slightly hyperpolarized to reduce the level of spontaneous activity, external stimulation of 40 adjacent excitatory neurons can initiate Up state propagation (Fig. 5A) with the firing rate profiles (Fig. 5C) being similar to those shown in Figure 3D of the original work. The histogram of the intervals between the first spike of each pyramidal cell and its immediately adjacent interneuron (Fig. 5B) closely resembles the original result in Figure 3C. In analogy to the original work, repeated network stimulation within a few seconds after the first one does not evoke an Up state transition (Fig. 5A).\nDuring the spontaneous Up-Down oscillations shown in Fig. 4A, synaptic and intrinsic neuronal conductances (Fig. 6B\u2013I) are tightly coupled to the membrane depolarization (Fig. 6A) and show a dynamic range very similar to that reported in the original Figure 5. When filtered with a rectangular kernel (see Methods), excitatory and inhibitory conductances are clearly coupled (Fig. 6E), like in the original model (see their Figure 6).\nWhen computed as the reciprocal of the sum of all conductances (see Eq. 2), membrane resistance is decreased during Up states relative to silent Down states (Fig. 6B, 7), consistent with the results shown in Figure 5B of the original work. We also estimated membrane resistance by injecting hyperpolarizing DC pulses (300pA for 100ms) into neurons, constantly hyperpolarized by 250pA current injection (see Fig. 7A), similar to the way described in the original Figure 4. In agreement with the original paper, the resulting membrane resistance, computed as the voltage deflection at the end of the pulse divided by the pulse amplitude (Fig. 7B dots) is quantitatively similar to the values obtained with the reciprocal of Eq. 2 (Fig. 7 solid line) at least for membrane potentials below \u221280mV.\nHowever, note that the authors define membrane conductance as\nGmodelm = \u2211 i Gi (V ) (2)\nwhere Gi are the instantaneous conductances of all ionic channels, which are typically time- and voltage-dependent. This definition corresponds to the \u201cinstantaneous chord conductance\u201d according to the classification given by [7]. In contrast, the typical\nReScience | rescience.github.io 11 October 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nReScience | rescience.github.io 12 October 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nReScience | rescience.github.io 13 October 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nReScience | rescience.github.io 14 October 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nexperimentally measured quantity corresponds to \u201csteady-state slope conductance\u201d from the same classification:\nGexpm = \u2206I\n\u2206V (3)\nwhere \u2206I is the extra current (injected into the soma) required to achieve a steadystate membrane potential shift \u2206V = V \u2212V0 from the initial level V0 (prior to current injection). The steady state here refers to the situation where transient capacitive currents become negligible. To compare these two definitions we use the fact that in the steady-state case, the externally injected current I is equal to minus the sum of all ionic currents,\nI = \u2211 i Gi (V ) \u00b7 (V \u2212 Ei) , (4)\nwhere Ei is the reversal potential of channel i. Combining Eqs 3 and 4 and using\n\u2206(Gi (V ) \u00b7 (V \u2212 Ei)) = \u2206 (Gi (V )) \u00b7 (V \u2212 Ei) +Gi (V ) \u00b7\u2206(V \u2212 Ei) = \u2206 (Gi (V )) \u00b7 (V \u2212 Ei) +Gi (V ) \u00b7\u2206V\nresults in an overall membrane conductance\nGexpm = \u2211 i \u2206(Gi (V ) \u00b7 (V \u2212 Ei)) \u2206V = \u2211 i \u2206(Gi (V )) \u2206V (V \u2212 Ei) + \u2211 i Gi (V ) . (5)\nAs one can see, the definition used in the original study (Eq. 2) excludes the first term. To demonstrate the difference in these two definitions, we simulate isolated pyramidal neurons (parameters are set to average values) with DC inputs of different amplitudes injected for 20 seconds into the soma and record the membrane potential (Fig. 8A) as well as all ionic channel conductances. A long pulse duration is chosen here to take into account the long time required for the model neuron to reach a steady state. Then we compute membrane conductance according to Eq. 5 and Eq. 2 a few milliseconds before the DC input is switched off. The I-V curve shows a profound nonlinearity (Fig. 8B) leading to Gexpm (the reciprocal of the slope of the I-V curve) reaching 0.012nS (corresponding to 83G\u2126), while Gmodelm remains near 15nS (corresponding to 0.07G\u2126) (Fig. 8C). Therefore, under the protocol mimicking a standard electrophysiological procedure, the instantaneous chord and steady-state slope conductances deviate by\nReScience | rescience.github.io 15 October 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nseveral orders of magnitude for the present neuron model. To measure the steady-state slope conductance (Eq. 3) during ongoing network activity in the model, we use the virtual hyperpolarization method (see Methods). Freezing the state of the neuron as done in this method is necessary because of the aforementioned long relaxation time of the model neurons, which necessitates pulse durations that exceed the length of an Up state and therefore prevents measuring steady-state resistances during freely evolving activity. The results of this method for the above case of prolonged DC stimulation closely match those obtained from the I-V curve (Fig. 8C). In the active network model, this method results in a membrane conductance around 2nS (corresponding to 500M\u2126) during the Down state (Fig. 9B,C). During the Up states, however, membrane conductance tends to drop to zero and even becomes negative for 5 \u2212 75ms with an average of 32ms before oncoming spike events, indicating self-depolarizing dynamics in the subthreshold periods. Note that in Fig. 9B,C time periods of 5ms before and after each spike event are not considered to avoid the contamination of subthreshold dynamics with spikes.\nFinally, in the original work modification of e-to-i and i-to-e synaptic weights by 10% results in noticeable differences in spiking activity, though oscillations are qualitatively preserved (see their Figure 6). In our model, however, similar modification of synaptic weights results in negligible differences in spiking activity. Also, when AMPA, NDMA, or GABA conductances are blocked in the model, corresponding changes in the spiking pattern are similar in the original (their Figure 9) and the present model\nReScience | rescience.github.io 16 October 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\n(Fig. 10)."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "After modifications to the model with respect to synaptic dynamics and strength, we are able to reproduce the majority of the original results concerning spontaneously generated and stimulation-evoked Up-Down oscillations. In particular, the dynamics of membrane potentials, membrane resistances, channel conductances, intracellular concentrations of Na+ and Ca2+ ions, and spiking activity closely resemble those of the original model. In our implementation, the synaptic dynamics does not depend on the shapes of individual presynaptic action potentials, but just incorporates the average postsynaptic effect of an action potential. The fact that we can reproduce the emerging network phenomena suggests that this detail of the synapse model is not relevant on the network level. We provide a closer look at the method which the authors of the original study use to access neuronal conductance (or resistance). Their measure reflects an \u201cinstantaneous chord conductance\u201d, which results in the model in values around 15nS in an isolated pyramidal neuron, and around 20nS throughout network activity. In experimental works, the typical measure approximates a \u201csteady-state slope conductance\u201d (see [7] for classification), which results in a membrane conductance of less than 1nS for a slightly depolarized isolated pyramidal neuron. Throughout network activity, this yields around 2nS during Down states, strongly fluctuating membrane conductance during subthreshold Up state periods, and a strong negative conductance lasting on average 32ms before each spike event. These low and even negative long-lasting conductances are typically not reported in the experimental literature. Therefore, the dynamics of membrane conductance in the model merits further investigation. The present model successfully reproduces the network response to blockade of AMPA, NMDA, or GABA channels. However, the sensitivity of the present model to changes in the synaptic strengths is weaker than in the original model.\nWe could not obtain the desired network regime with the synaptic weights reported\nReScience | rescience.github.io 17 October 2016 | Volume 2 | Issue 1\nin the original work after calibration to account for the change in the synaptic model.
