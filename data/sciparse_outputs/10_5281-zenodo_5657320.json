We considered the synaptic weights as unitary, i.e., wi,CS = wi,CTX = \u2212wij = 1.\n\u2022 Theneuronmodel equationused in the original text (Equation 5 of [2]) has a dimen\u2010 sional inconsistency. By reviewing the references cited by the authors, we found our Equation 5 in reference [6], which describes the same neuronal dynamics. We adopted this equation here with the same parameters given in [6] and shown in Table 2.\n\u2022 The description of the synapticmodel was also extracted from reference [6], where the synaptic conductances are given by a difference of exponentials with \u03c4r = \u03c4d = 0.326ms. To implement the difference of exponentials in Brian 2, it was necessary to use two ordinary differential equations as shown in Equations 6 and 7.\n\u2022 Due to the lack of details on the application of AC and DC currents to model the BKG input, we opted for the use of Poisson train generators (Table 4), which promoted a spontaneous activity compatible with what was experimentally ex\u2010 pected [7].\n\u2022 To replicate the results obtained in the evolution of synaptic weights, we used the values ofCS andCTX shown in Table 4, which differ from those described in the supplementary material of the reference article [2].\n\u2022 In Equations 9 and 10, we named the parameters cu and hu instead ofA andB as in the reference article [2] to avoid misunderstandings in relation to subpopulations A andB.Wealso specified in these equations tpre\u2212CS and tpre\u2212CTX , which indicate when increments in auxiliary variables occur.\n\u2022 In assessing how the increase in network connectivity introduces gamma oscilla\u2010 tions, the authors did not clearly show how the frequency of population activity and the synchrony index were determined. In our replication, we used PSD to check the frequency of oscillations in the spiking activity of the network and chose population Fano Factor as the synchrony index.\n\u2022 In Figure 9, we used 10 CS presentations which was the minimum number of presentation necessary to reproduce the original result."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "In this section, we present the results obtained from our simulations as described in Methods, which qualitatively reproduce the main results of the reference article."}, {"heading": "Mean-field model", "text": "Despite the lack of information provided by the authors for this model, we have repro\u2010 duced qualitatively the expected dynamics for the conditioning and extinction phases as shown in Figure 3A.

Therefore, we studied the evolution of the synaptic weights wA/B,CS by simply using the stimuli arrays and Equation 4 without simultaneously simulating the inputs. The synaptic weights evolution in Figure 3B is in accordance with what was reported in the reference paper (Figures 4C\u2010D of [2]).\nReScience C 7.1 (#9) \u2013 Carvalho et al. 2021 9\nSpiking neuron network model of BA\nSpontaneous Activity \u2014 In Figure 4 we show the raster plot of the simulated spontaneous activity of the network. The firing rates measured were 0.03 and 10.54 Hz per neuron for the excitatory and the inhibitory populations, respectively. This is compatible with the firing rates observed experimentally [7]. This consistency test was not presented in the original work.\nDynamics of conditioning and extinction processes \u2014 In Figure 5A we show the raster plot of spiking activity during the conditioning and extinction processes. The activities of subpopulations A and B, which represent fear and extinction neurons, respectively, are\nReScience C 7.1 (#9) \u2013 Carvalho et al. 2021 10\nhighlighted. After each presentation of CS during the conditioning phase, there is an increase in the firing rate of popA. On the other hand, in the extinction phase, after the first presentations of CS the popA firing rate gradually decreases while the firing rate of popB increases (Figure 5B). During these phases, the activity of the inhibitory neurons slightly fluctuated for each presentation of CS as shown in Figure 5C.\nIn the caption of Figure 5 of the reference article, the authors explain that popA and popB, each one, corresponds to 50% of the total excitatory neurons. However, this is in disagreement with the methodology presented by them. In our study, we considered 20% of the total excitatory neurons for each subpopulation as described in the original methodology and shown in Figure 2. We evaluated 30 simulations for the conditioning and extinction dynamics, and in all of them it was possible to verify the same scenario presented in Figure 5. In general, after each presentation of CS there is an increase in synaptic weights associated with the CTX applied followed by a decay when this CTX is inactivated. Thus, the results relative to the average firing rates and synaptic weights (Figure 6) are consistent as ex\u2010 pected from the synaptic plasticity rules applied (Equation 8), and compatible with the original study.\nReScience C 7.1 (#9) \u2013 Carvalho et al. 2021 11\nFear renewal \u2014 The results for these simulations are shown in Figures 7 and 8, and should be compared to Figures 7A\u2010C and Figures 7E\u2010H of the reference paper, respectively. In Figure 7A we show the spiking raster plot for the simulation, and in Figure 7B\u2010C the ac\u2010 tivities of the excitatory and inhibitory populations, respectively. During the transition from the extinction to the renewal phase: i) the change of CTX causes a sudden mod\u2010 ification in the firing rates of popA and popB neurons (Figures 7B and 8A); but ii) this effect barely influences the CS and CTX synaptic weights due to the synaptic plasticity rules (Figures 8B and 8C). In accordance with the reference article, the rapid change in the activity of subpopula\u2010 tions is a network phenomenon and not an effect of synaptic plasticity, although it plays an important role in the whole dynamics that precedes the renovation. Additionally, we observed a slight change in CS and CTX weights in the transition from extinction to renewal, which might be related to the difference between the time constants used in our replication and the original model (this could indicate that our \u03c4h/c is slightly faster) to simulate the synaptic plasticity.\nReScience C 7.1 (#9) \u2013 Carvalho et al. 2021 12\nReScience C 7.1 (#9) \u2013 Carvalho et al. 2021 13\nReScience C 7.1 (#9) \u2013 Carvalho et al. 2021 14\nHigh connectivity introduces gamma oscillations \u2014 In the corresponding section of the refer\u2010 ence article, the connection probability pII (defined here in Table 3) was increased to the experimentally reported value of 0.5 [10] to study the effect of this high connectivity on the behavior of the spiking network model. The authors reported that this change in the network did not affect the qualitative behavior of the model but a new aspect emerged in the dynamics: gamma oscillations in the network firing rate. With a careful inspection of Figure 8A of the main reference, we noted that the authors studied this phenomenon only for the conditioning phase and, to obtain a similar re\u2010 sult, we increase the amount of CS presentations to 10 (this result is dependent on the number of CS presentations). The results for this procedure are shown in Figure 9.\nIn Figure 9A, we show a raster plot of the spiking activity for the last four CS presenta\u2010 tions. At each presentation the neurons fire in a more synchronous fashion as can be seen in Figure 9B. The PSD of this synchronous activity is shown in Figure 9C and it dis\u2010 plays a peak at 66.41 Hz, within the gamma oscillation range (30\u201080 Hz). Thus, through our approximation, we obtained a similar result to that observed in Figure 8A of the original work. Further, the authors investigated how the network properties impact the overall syn\u2010\nReScience C 7.1 (#9) \u2013 Carvalho et al. 2021 15\nchrony. To illustrate the meaning of the synchrony index used in this replication, in Figure 10 we show time series of the synchrony index for three different types of activity of the inhibitory population (obtained with different values of pII ). As gamma oscilla\u2010 tions emerge, the synchrony index increases. In particular, we show that the oscillatory power of the network is positively correlated with the synchrony index. Specifically for this network the characteristic oscillations are always within the gamma band. We will assume that a synchrony index greater than 4.5 characterizes the presence of gamma oscillations.\nTo explore mechanisms operating in BA that could dampen gamma oscillations, the au\u2010 thors of the original text investigated the measure of synchrony as a function of connec\u2010 tivity, synaptic weights and delays between inhibitory neurons. The pII connectivity was analyzed from 0.1 to 0.9, at 0.1 intervals; synaptic weights wII were set to 1, 2 or 3 nS; and delays were divided in two groups: \u201chigher\u201d, uniformly distributed between [1.0\u2212 2.0]ms, and \u201clower\u201d, uniformly distributed between [0.2\u2212 1.0]ms. Figure 11 shows the synchrony index for simulations with all possible combinations of these three groups of parameters. Gamma oscillations are not present (regions bel\u2010 low the purple dashed line in Figure 11) for both delay scenarios (\u201chigher\u201d and \u201clower\u201d) when one of the following conditions is true: (i) pII lower than 0.4, or (ii) wII = 1 nS independently of pII . For delay type \u201clower\u201d, there is a reduction of oscillations in all sit\u2010 uations, which is compatible with the reference article. Thus, changes in the inhibitory structure of the network are essential to obtain gamma oscillations in neuronal activity.\nReScience C 7.1 (#9) \u2013 Carvalho et al. 2021 16\nBlockage of inhibition \u2014 Inhibition plays an important role in controlling the firing rate of the network as can be seen in Figure 5A, in which the firing rate of excitatory neurons not belonging to subpopulations A and B (black dots) remains close to zero even with presentations of CS. Based on this, we performed two additional sets of simulations wherewedeactivated first 50%and then 90%of inhibitory neurons during the extinction phase.\nReScience C 7.1 (#9) \u2013 Carvalho et al. 2021 17\nIn Figure 12, we show the raster plot of spiking neuronal activity for 90% of inhibitory blockage. The firing rates of all excitatory neurons are abruptly increased when in\u2010 hibitory neurons are deactivated during CTXB presentation. To highlight this effect, in Figure 13 we show the firing rate during the last CS presentation (corresponding to Figure 8C of the original paper). As expected, the increase in the fraction of \u201cblocked\u201d inhibitory cells provokes an increase in the firing rate, and this effect is even stronger for the extinction neurons (popB). This suggests that if the relative difference between the activities of the fear and extinction neuronswere crucial, extinctionmust be favored by the blockage of inhibition in this scenario.\nReScience C 7.1 (#9) \u2013 Carvalho et al. 2021 18"}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "We replicated twomodels proposed by Vlachos et al.
