We have been unable to compile this original implementation but we were able to run the provided Windows executable. We found some factual errors in the original article that have been corrected in this implementation. The initialization of weights are defined in two different parts of the paper. First on page 3030 (second column) \u201cWeights were initialized to a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0.5 and a SD of 0.005 at the start of each simulation\u2026\u201d, then on page 3031 in the caption of figure 4, \u201cAll synaptic weights were initialized to 0.5\u201d. It happened that both definitions are right but do not address the same projections. Cortico-striatal synaptic weights use Gaussian distribution while all other weights are set to 0.5. Furthermore, the Boltzmann equation given in the original paper uses a . instead of + between first term and second term.\nReScience | rescience.github.io 1 Aug 2015 | Volume 1 | Issue 1\nOne notable modification in our implementation is the reinforcement learning rule that has been greatly simplified. Original authors have been using quite a complex algorithm for ensuring that \u201ccorticostriatal weights are bounded by a sigmoidal transfer function to represent physical constraints on synaptic growth with an absolute maximum of 0.75 and an absolute minimum of 0.25.\u201d. This algorithm is not described in the article, but from sources, it appears that it is based on the estimation of the weight gradient along the sigmoid. We use instead an Oja-like rule given in the Synapse table.\nWe provide below the formal description of the model according to the proposition of Nordlie et al.

Noise has a great influence on the overall dynamic and it is not possible to exactly reproduce figure 4 in the original article without precise information on the underlying random generator(seed). Consequently, we can only report a qualitatively equivalent figure where the most critical feature is the bifurcation in cognitive and motor activities after stimulus onset. Since no learning has occured yet, it is also possible to have the motor decision to occur before the cognitive decision. Figure 1 shows an example of a decision dynamic with an oscillatory regime between time t=0 and time t=500ms that is characteristic of the model.\nWe also tested the learning capacity of the model by reproducing the same procedure as in the original article (250 experiments, 120 trials) but we used a modified and simpler learning rule (see Plasiticity table) since the original learning rule used a sigmodial transfer function but no actual details were given on how to enforce it.\nReScience | rescience.github.io 4 Aug 2015 | Volume 1 | Issue 1\nReScience | rescience.github.io 5 Aug 2015 | Volume 1 | Issue 1"}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "After some minor corrections and modifications of the original description of the model, we were able to reproduce the original results, confirming the correctness of the original implementation of the model."}], "title": "[Re] Interaction between cognitive and motor cortico-basal ganglia loops during decision making: a computational study", "year": 2015}
