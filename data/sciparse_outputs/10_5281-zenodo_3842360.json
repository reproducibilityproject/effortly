{"abstractText": "DOI 10.5281/zenodo.3842360 Abstract: Dopamine neurons in freely moving rats often fire behaviorally relevant high\u2010frequency bursts, but depolarization block limits the maximum steady firing rate of dopamine neurons in vitro to \u224810 Hz. Using a reduced model that faithfully reproduces the sodium current measured in these neurons, we show that adding an additional slow component of sodium channel inacti\u2010 vation, recently observed in these neurons, qualitatively changes in two different ways how the model enters into depolarization block. First, the slow time course of inactivation allowsmultiple spikes to be elicited during a strong depolarization prior to entry into depolarization block. Sec\u2010 ond, depolarization block occurs near or below the spike threshold, which ranges from \u201045 to \u201030 mV in vitro, because the additional slow component of inactivation negates the sodium window current. In the absence of the additional slow component of inactivation, this window current produces an N\u2010shaped steady\u2010state current\u2010voltage (I\u2010V) curve that prevents depolarization block in the experimentally observed voltage range near \u201040 mV. The time constant of recovery from slow inactivation during the interspike interval limits the maximum steady firing rate observed prior to entry into depolarization block. These qualitative features of the entry into depolariza\u2010 tion block can be reversed experimentally by replacing the native sodium conductance with a virtual conductance lacking the slow component of inactivation. We show that the activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors can affect bursting and depolarization block in different ways, de\u2010 pending upon their relative contributions to depolarization versus to the total linear/nonlinear conductance.", "authors": [{"affiliations": [], "name": "Mary Upshall"}, {"affiliations": [], "name": "Aaron R.

Normally, DA neurons located in the midbrain fire in two different regimes: single spikes and bursts of action potentials. Previous studies have suggested that an imbalance between these two regimes may play a critical role in the physiopathology of schizophrenia [3]. Antipsychotic drugs used to manage schizophrenia exert their thera\u2010 peutic action via depolarization\u2010induced inactivation of midbrain dopamine cell activ\u2010 ity [4]. Therefore, understanding the way that these neurons enter into depolarization block may potentially lead to improved therapeutics [5].\nQian et al. (2014) studied depolarization block in two simplified models (3\u2010dimensional and 2\u2010dimensional) which are proposed reductions of a more complex 5\u2010dimensional model. The 5D model was a single compartment model used to capture the essential\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 M. Upshall and A.R. Shifman, released under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The following three currents were used: fast sodium (INa), delayed rectifier potassium (IK) and leak current(Ileak). The corresponding gating variables used were the activation of sodium current (m), the fast inactivation (h) and slow inactivation of sodium current (hs), and the activation of potas\u2010 sium current (n). The equations governing each gating variable were comprised of volt\u2010 age dependent steady\u2010states (described by Boltzmann function) and finally, the time constants specific to the gating variables at membrane potential (v). The specifics of these equations can be found in Table 1 and page 2 of the original manuscript.\nPrevious work had revealed that a failure to recover from sodium channel inactivation is one way to enter into depolarization block, as the availability of sodium channels limits the maximum firing rate of DA cells [5, 6, 7]. Previous work also suggested that this unavailability of sodium channels may have been caused by a slow inactivation component of sodium channels (represented here as hs) [8]. Elaborating on this hypoth\u2010 esis, Qian et al. (2014) developed a simplifiedmodelling framework based on a previous model. These new models, the 3D and 2D model, either included or excluded a slow in\u2010 activation term (hs) respectively, to analyze the role of the slow inactivating component.\nTo generate the 3D and 2Dmodels, the authors\u2019 performed amodel reduction by separa\u2010 tion of timescales method. The activation of sodium current was very fast compared to the time course of the other state variables and so it was set to steady\u2010state value. Next, the time constants for the activation of potassium current (n) and the fast inactivation of sodium current (h) had similar time scales, hence n was set as a function of h (f(h)). The details of this equation will be discussed in the Discussion section. As a result, the 3Dmodel contained 3 state variables (v, h, and hs), while the 2Dmodel contained 2 state variables (v and h) with hs set to 1 to eliminate slow inactivation.\nThe authors found that while their new models matched in vitro measurements of DA neurons; adding a slow component of sodium inactivation qualitatively changed how the model entered depolarization block. Specifically, the slow time course of inactiva\u2010 tion allows multiple spikes prior to entry into depolarization block, and that the block (cessation in firing) occurs near or below spike threshold (\u201045 to \u201030 mV in vitro). Inter\u2010 estingly, they also attempted to clarify the controversy regarding the role of NMDA and AMPA receptors, where they show that depending on the relative contributions to de\u2010 polarization, these receptors can affect bursting and depolarization block in different ways.\nWe aim to replicate Figures 1\u20134 and 6 of the originalmanuscript [5], (we omit their Figure 5 as it consists of experimental data). As such, our Figures 1\u20134 correspond to the authors\u2019\nFigures 1\u20134, however, our Figure 5 corresponds to their Figure 6. It is important to note that we could not fully replicate all of their figures, we\u2019ve discussed this with the original authors and they provided uswithwhat code they had available. Unfortunately the code was incomplete (only contained the model definition for the 2D and 3Dmodels), and we could not be sure if it was the final version. We comparedwhatwe hadwith the available code and noted that there were no significant differences other than a few differences in some of the coefficients in the equation used to reduce the 5Dmodel. These differences are elaborated on in the Discussion section.\n2 Methods\nThis replication uses the model described by Qian et al. (2014), and personal communi\u2010 cation with the authors. While the original study computed all simulations, bifurcation diagrams, and nullclines using XPPAUT, our replication uses Python3.6 (for full pack\u2010 age specifications including version numbers, please see the included requirements file\nReScience C 6.3 (#1) \u2013 Upshall and Shifman 2020 2\nin the code repository). We solve the ODEs with the scipy odeint function which is a stiffness\u2010switching adaptive solver. 1.5\u00d7 10\u22128 was used for the relative and absolute tol\u2010 erance (except Figure 1Cwhich uses 1\u00d710\u22123 due to stiffness issues). Solutions are saved with a resolution of 0.1 ms. Additionally we used pyDSTool [9] for computing bifurca\u2010 tion diagrams, which provides a python interface to the AUTO bifurcation environment. For plots with a periodic solution, we typically discard the first 1000 ms of the solution to eliminate the transient, and in Figure 1C we discard the first half of the solution.\nOur code consists of two packages (generators and ode_functions) used to compute the solutions. The ode_functions package provides common tools for solving the ODE prob\u2010 lems in the original works. The current module contains a collection of functions for computing different types of current for each model, such as membrane current, indi\u2010 vidual ionic current, and AMPA/NMDA current. The gating module defines all gating functions for ODEs. This includes all the gating equations that were provided in the original works. Next, diff_eq is a monolithic module for solving all ODE problems. It provides functionality to create 2D, 3D, and 5D ODE systems, as well as managing initial conditions. As previously noted, this module uses scipy to solve the ODEs. The exper iment module contains helpers for performing experimental manipulations including clamping, and sequences of discrete pulses. Lastly, the nullclines module contains a col\u2010 lection of functions for computing nullclines and generating traces with them.\nThe generators package provides a module for creating each figure 1\u20104, and 6 from the original works. Additionally, we have a plotting, and units modules for generating fig\u2010 ures, handling units. The entire implementation is run with the run script which takes arguments as seen in the README. The model description is directly from page 1 and 2 of the original paper. Additionally, the model gating variables are from Table 1, and definitions for the reducedmodels are taken from page 3. It should also be noted that in order to get qualitatively similar results to those shown in Figure 1D2we change the time constant equation (Table 1 of the original manuscript) for the activation of potassium current (\u03c4n) for all simulations as follows:\n\u03c4noriginal = 1 + 19e \u2212( ln(1+0.05(V +40))0.05 ) 2 /300 (1)\n\u03c4nmodified = 1 + 19e \u2212( ln(1+0.05(V +60))0.05 ) 2 /300 (2)\nIn the equation above, the membrane potential is represented by V . Using the original time constant equation we found significantly different results (see Supplemental 1D1). We noticed that the original \u03c4n definition contained a term ln (1 + 0.05(v + 40)) i.e. for any V \u2264 \u221260 this function would be undefined. Examining the original figures we can see V extends past that point, we therefore (somewhat arbitrarily) set the offset to 60 giving a minimum function range of \u221280mV. While this was a guess, it yielded a model which looked qualitatively similar. For a summary of all replication changes, see Table 1.\n3 Results\nWe attempt to replicate all original figures, with the exception of Figure 5 (experimen\u2010 tal data). Figures 1, 2 and 6 had some minor and major discrepancies, which will be addressed accordingly.\n3.1 Figure 1 In Figure 1, the authors demonstrated the validity of their reduced 2D and 3Dmodels. In Figure 1A they plotted the peak currents of themodelswith andwithout hs (slow sodium\nReScience C 6.3 (#1) \u2013 Upshall and Shifman 2020 3\ngating) against experimental data from [10]. This successfully showed that they had not compromised the fit of the original sodium current description to previously published data, as both models overlay the experimental data at the same points. The experiment involved repeatedly clamping V to \u2010120mV then clamping it to a new voltage for each plotted potential. For each sequential clamp the peak sodium current was measured. For this simulation the authors specified gNa = 5.92nS/cm2 (in this work typical conduc\u2010 tances are on the order of mS/cm2). Using this number we create nearly 0 current (see Supplemental 1A(v1)). If we assume this was a typo and the authors meant gNa = 5.92 mS/cm2 we produce a current approximately 2 times larger than it should be (see Sup\u2010 plemental 1A(v2)). By scaling gNa based taking the ratio of the peak amplitudes between the authors plot and supplemental 1A(v2), which is 0.514: we achieve Figure 1A which shows both nearly identical results for the models with and without hs, and strong simi\u2010 larity to the originalmanuscript. We conclude this based on the plateau at the beginning maintaining position at 0 pA until \u201040 mV is reached and the downward slope toward a trough just before 0 mV is reached, followed by the upward slope toward 0 pA again.\nNext, their Figure 1B displayed the effect of slow inactivation of sodium current when a 3 ms depolarizing clamp to 0 mV was repeatedly applied to the model at 100 ms inter\u2010 vals from a holding potential of \u221270 mV. Again, we assume that sodium conductance should have been given in mS/cm2 and the authors specified a magnitude of 9.12 with a depolarizing pulse width of 3 ms. Their base numbers cause a figure which does not match. Through experimentation with different amplitudes and pulse widths we set\u2010 tled on gNa = 5.92 and a 5 ms pulse width (for other combinations see supplemental figures 1B(v1), 1B(v2), and 1B(v3)). With our corrected implementation (Figure 1B), we see an initial pulse at 0 ms to \u2010250 pA, followed by 4 pulses spaced 100 ms apart, gradu\u2010 ally ascending to approximately \u2010200 pA, similar to the original implementation. There are slight differences in amplitude and we assume this is due to a slightly different gNa.\nIn reducing the 5D model, Qian et al. (2014) modified the potassium current activation (n) to a be a function of fast inactivation of sodium current (h) as they share similar gating kinetics. As such, n was approximated by a function of h i.e. (f(h)) where 0 \u2264 f(h) \u2264 1. f was defined as a cubic function, with coefficients for the polynomial using a least\u2010squares fit. This was shown in their Figure 1C where f(h) was compared to the limit cycle projected onto the n, h phase space. In our replication (Figure 1C) does not match the authors\u2019, which is not surprising considering that we\u2019re using a modified \u03c4n as explained above. However, importantly, the voltage waveforms (Figures 1D1 and 1D2) are nearly identical to the authors\u2019, implying that the ultimate dynamics are comparable.\nFigures 1D1 and 1D2 compared the 5D model to the 3D model respectively. This is well replicated with our implementation (Figures 1D1 and 1D2). The peaks all occur at approximately 10 mV and troughs occur at approximately \u201070 mV, as well as the same\nReScience C 6.3 (#1) \u2013 Upshall and Shifman 2020 4\ntimescale of pacemaking events. It is important to note that Figure 1D1 (5Dmodel) used the modified time constant equation for the activation of sodium current. Supplemen\u2010 tal Figure 1D1 shows the pacemaking activity with the original time constant equation, where the troughs are rounded and look considerably different from the original works (see Supplemental 1D1).\n3.2 Figure 2 Figure 2 of the original implementation analyzed a depolarization event using the 2D model (without hs). Their Figure 2A demonstrated that applying a current step caused a \u201cringing\u201d (increase in frequency and decrease in amplitude) just before entry into de\u2010 polarization block (stabilized at \u201019 mV), with their voltage scale ranging from \u201050 mV to 20 mV. We observe this same \u201cringing\u201d in our replication (Figure 2A), however it is significantly shorter in terms of event length. Additionally, our voltage scale ranges from \u201070 mV to 40 mV. Without access to their original code, it is hard to conclude why we see this discrepancy especially since part A and B of this figure reuse the same code for the model implementation, and part B looks correct. However, we show the same qualitative results \u2010 i.e. ringing prior to entry into depolarization block. The authors\u2019 Figures 2B1 and 2B2 were a nullcline analysis of h with an applied current of 0 \u00b5A/cm2 and 3.5 \u00b5A/cm2 respectively. Our replications of both show identical results, demonstrated in our Figures 2B1 and B2. In Figure 2B1 we see the same shape of the V\u2010nullcline maximum where the unstable fixed point is located at the same point of intersection, and the slope of the h\u2010nullcline is the same. In Figure 2B2, again we see the same shape of the V\u2010nullcline with the stable fixed point located at the same point of intersection, and the slope of the h\u2010nullcline is the same.\n3.3 Figure 3 Qian et al. (2014) then analyzed the entry into depolarization block with the 3D model. Their Figure 3A1 plottedmembrane current of the 3Dmodel followed by an applied cur\u2010 rent causing depolarization block. They demonstrated that slow inactivation of sodium current provided a mechanism for spike frequency adaptation as opposed to the \u201cring\u2010 ing\u201d seen with the 2D model. Our implementation, shown in Figure 3A1, replicates this well. We see the same increase in oscillation frequency post\u2010stimulus, as well as the\nReScience C 6.3 (#1) \u2013 Upshall and Shifman 2020 5\nsame instantaneous frequencies for each interspike interval leading up to depolariza\u2010 tion block (overlaid with right axis). In Figure 3A2 the authors investigated the contri\u2010 bution of hs to htotal (defined as htotal = hs \u00b7 h) with the same applied current seen in\nFigure 3A1. This is also well replicated in our Figure 3A2, which demonstrates large os\u2010 cillations in hs and htotal at the beginning of the time course, which then decrease in amplitude and frequency post\u2010stimulus, followed by a cessation in firing at the end of the time course. In Figures 3B1\u2013B4 the authors also performed a nullcline analysis and outlined the ef\u2010 fects of varying the current stimulus and hs. The hs, and bias current parameters were taken from characteristic regimes in Figure 3A2 (pre\u2010stimulus, amplitude decay, am\u2010 plitude plateau, and cessation). Our results, shown in Figures 3B1\u2013B4, replicate their results well. In each nullcline analysis we see the same position and shapes of the max\u2010 ima of the V\u2010nullcline and the same consistent slope of the h\u2010nullcline. The points of intersection with the three unstable points and one stable point corresponding to B1\u2013B3 and B4 respectively, are all located at the same location as the original works.\nSimilarly, Figures 3C and 3D are well replicated. 3C was a bifurcation analysis with hs as the bifurcation parameter overlaid with the trajectory. Here we see the same location of the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, the same slight slope of the stable fixed point, as well as the same unique trajectory shape throughout. 3D shows the results of speeding up slow inactivation of sodium current by a factor of 2, where we have a faster convergence toward the fixed point and fewer spikes, as seen in the original implementation.\nReScience C 6.3 (#1) \u2013 Upshall and Shifman 2020 6\nReScience C 6.3 (#1) \u2013 Upshall and Shifman 2020 7\nthe left of the pacemaking region in Figure 4B1, and the single branch of fixed points in\nFigure 4B2. Of note is a difference in naming conventions: the authors\u2019 use SNP (saddle node of periodic), our implementation uses LPC (limit point of cycles).\nLastly, the originalworks produced current\u2010voltage (I\u2010V) curves as they aremore familiar to electrophysiologists. Their Figure 4C1 was the nonmonotonic IV curve (2D model) which is required for a saddle node bifurcation to initiate spiking [5], and their Figure 4C2 was the monotonic IV curve (3D model) which the authors\u2019 had noted was often associated with a Hopf bifurcation for spike initiation. They used these figures to show that monotonic curves should be produced with voltage clamp steps on the order of seconds or with very slow ramp current, and conversely, nonmonotonic curves should be produced with fast ramps that do not allow sufficient slow inactivation of the sodium channel current. We replicate these in our Figures 4C1 and 4C2 by clamping the voltage and computing the membrane current across voltage steps. There are slight differences in the zero\u2010crossing point, and scale of the I\u2010V curves between our implementation and the authors. This could arise from the authors using a slightly non\u2010standard definition of I\u2010V curve, or slightly different parameters.\n3.5 Figure 5 Finally, the authors studied the effects of NMDA and AMPA currents on the entry into depolarization block. As we did not duplicate Figure 5 (experimental data), their Figure 6 corresponds to our Figure 5. Their Figure 6 demonstrated that the activation of NMDA receptors can delay entry into depolarization block, but activation of AMPA receptors cannot. They used these receptors as amore physiologically relevantmethod of depolar\u2010 ization of dopamine neurons. The authors\u2019 mentioned that in previous literature there had been some controversy as to the role of these receptors in depolarization block, and so they examined how the activation of these receptors interactedwith the slow inactiva\u2010 tion of the sodium channel in their model. In the original works, their Figures 6A1, A2, and A3 displayed the results for the minimal NMDA current, AMPA current, or injected current required to induce depolarization block in the 3Dmodel. Unfortunately they did not specify the reversal potentials for EAMPA, or ENMDA so we assume they were set to 0 mV \u2010 as is common [11]. We replicate the current pulse portion of this figure using the 3D model (shown in our Figure 5A1\u2013A3), where we see the same style of frequency in\u2010 crease until depolarization block occurs around \u201048 mV (Figure 5A3). However, we used different parameters for the channel conductance since the parameters specified by the authors (on the order of nS/cm2) were insufficient to introduce depolarization block. We started with their given parameters (2.3, and 60) assuming the correct unit was mS/cm2 and then sequentially scaled the constant until we achieved results which were similar in appearance. As a result the conductance value of gAMPA wasmodified from 2.3 nS/cm2 to 2.3 \u00b5S/cm2. Similarly the NMDA conductance value was changed from 60 nS/cm2 to 2.22 \u00b5S/cm2. Although the replication is not perfect, we still see most of the same key features with a longer delay of entry into depolarization block post\u2010stimulus. However, depolarization block occurs at a higher value of \u201050mV rather than their result of \u201043mV in the case of NMDA.\nNext, the author\u2019s compared the same three manipulations at a constant final level of depolarization in order to focus on the effect of linearity versus nonlinearity of the ac\u2010 tivated conductance. With their results, they concluded that NMDA receptors delayed entry into depolarization block due to the nonlinearity of the NMDA conductancewhich allows it to compensate for the slow inactivation of sodium current. Conversely, they concluded that AMPA receptors have linear conductance which favours depolarization block. Our replication (Figure 5B1\u20103) originally had the same issues as seen in Figure 5A. However, when we applied the same scale factor to the AMPA and NMDA conductance values as we had applied in 5A, we obtained similar results. Figure 5B1 is the same as\nReScience C 6.3 (#1) \u2013 Upshall and Shifman 2020 8\nReScience C 6.3 (#1) \u2013 Upshall and Shifman 2020 9\nFigure 5A1, and therefore the NMDA conductance value as well as the results and their inconsistencies are the same. Our AMPA conductance value (again converting the 7 nS/cm2 to 7 \u00b5S/cm2) produces very similar results to the authors\u2019 original, with the same increase in spike frequency and relatively fast entry to depolarization block. Differently however, depolarization block itself occurs around \u201044 mV rather than their result of \u201043 mV (Figure 5B2). Lastly, Figure 6B3 is well replicated in our Figure 5B3, where entry into depolarization block happens relatively quickly.\n4 Discussion\nOverall, this implementation replicates the original paper. There are some inconsis\u2010 tencies with the 5D model (Figure 1), the 2D model (Figure 2) and with the analysis using NMDA receptors (Figure 6 of the original works). Upon speaking with the authors, they kindly provided us with one of their XPP files for the 3D model but unfortunately did not have the 5D model or the AMPA model. As previously mentioned, we found some discrepancies when replicating Figure 1C which we were able to partially restore by modifying \u03c4n (see Methods). The polynomial, f(h) = a0+a1+a2+a3 was used in the reduction of the model as described in the Methods section. The original constants for f(h) were a0 = 0.8158, a1 = \u22123.8768 a2 = 6.8838, and a3 = \u22124.2079. The constants pro\u2010 vided by the ODE file were a0 = 0.8437, a1 = \u22124.1480, a2 = 7.5234, and a3 = \u22124.6486.\nReScience C 6.3 (#1) \u2013 Upshall and Shifman 2020 10\nWhile the authors\u2019 ODE file contained a different set of constants for f(h), when we ran the model with the new constants, we found negligible qualitative and quantitative dif\u2010 ferences. Thus, the modified equation seems to be the best way to restore the proper model fit given in the original paper. Additionally, the AMPAmodel was absent from the provided XPP file, therefore we could not cross\u2010reference with their publishedmodel or verify the differences we found using our implementation. Although we could not be sure that our model was quantitatively implemented correctly, it was the closest solu\u2010 tion to restoring the qualitative features of their AMPA model. Lastly, we were unable to ascertain the reversal potential of either AMPA and NMDA in their XPP file or the manuscript, therefore we assume them both to be 0 mV [11]. Next, our Figure 2A has a shorter and less prominent \u201cringing\u201d period when entering depolarization block and there is a discrepancy with the voltage scale. Our scale ranges from \u201070mV to 40mV and their scale ranged from \u201050 mV to 20 mV. Despite this, the cessation in firing still occurs around \u201019 mV as demonstrated in the original implementation and has identical spike shapes prior to depolarization block. Lastly, our findings when originally replicating\nFigure 6 were dramatically different from that of the initial implementation. With the providedODEfile, it was unclear which conductanceswere used in themodel. Seeing as the bifurcation analysis replicated in our Figures 3 and 4 were nearly identical to theirs (strongly implying very similar if not identical dynamics), we do not believe the issue was in the model specification. Given their description we were unable to replicate Fig\u2010 ure 6, the reason being that we believe that the authors provided incorrect parameters. Taking this into consideration, wemanipulated the NMDA and AMPA conductances. Us\u2010 ing this technique, we were able to achieve quantitatively similar depolarization block for AMPA, but only qualitative behaviour in the NMDA model.\nDespite the discrepancies, our implementation by far demonstrates that all the major qualitative, and scientific results using the 2D and 3D models were implemented cor\u2010 rectly in the original works, if only slightly mis\u2010represented in the parameters used of the original manuscript."}, {"heading": "10.
